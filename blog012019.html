				<h2>2019!</h2>
				<h5>Date: 01/20/2019</h5>
				<p>
					2019 is a relatively bland number. It's just 3 times 673. <br>

					So focusing 20 and 19 instead, because they're both fun. <br> <br>

					<h3> 19 </h3>
					<br>
					19 is the 8th prime number. (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19) <br>
					19 is also the lowest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_triangular_number">centered triangular number</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_hexagonal_number">centered hexagonal number.</a> <br>
					19 is also the 7th Mersenne Prime exponent. 
					<br> <br>
					<h3> 20 </h3>
					20 is 2x2x5. <br>
					ANY 3x3x3 Rubiks cube can be solved under 20 moves (Quarter or half turns). <br>
					20 is also a tetrahedral number. <br>
					Icosahedron has 20 faces, while a dodecahedron has 20 verticies. <br>

					<br> <br>
					So at the end of the day, 2019 itself is boring, but its components are fun. Just like how the time of 2019 is boring, but the components, us, will have exciting futures!
					Or something like that.
