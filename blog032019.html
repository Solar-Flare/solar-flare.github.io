				<h2>Running in Circles (Circuits Part 1)</h2>
				<h5>Date: 03/03/2019</h5>
				<p>
					So circuits are shocking little designs that electrify devices, even the very screen you are reading this blog post on. But what exactly is a circuit and how does it do this? <br> <br>

					A circuit is a closed path which a electrical current can flow. An electrical current is defined as the movement of electrons; so in other words a circuit is simply a race track that electrons run around on. <br> <br>

					But that's pretty misleading. Imagine instead that this electrical circular race track is full of electrons; and one of them is pushed forward. This is basically like dominoes falling down in rapid succession; while the electron/domino itself is slow, it's the forward propulsion of momentum to other electron/dominoes that make electrical currents travel almost instantaneously in a circuit with almost no resistance. <br> <br>

					This electrical circuit ultimately carries with it a force (usually done through batteries; electrons are attracted to the positive end of the battery and so will move towards it, doing that push described earlier) which can then be utilized... for other things.
