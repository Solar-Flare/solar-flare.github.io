			<h2>Probabilities Part 1 - Coin</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/26/2018</h5>
			<p>
				We normally attribute flipping a coin as having a 50/50 chance, so such is often used to decide one thing out of a pair. <br>
				There is one problem: it's not. <br> <br>
				What if it lands on its side? Such an event albeit being very rare is still certainly possible. If that happens, do you just not choose both since one side correlates to an option? Or do you just flip again? <br>
				It probably happens too rarely for you to even consider that case though, if you were to decide a case by coin flip. No one would stop and think about what to do if it lands on its side, they just flip the coin having defined heads = A and tails = B, without considering what to do if side comes up.<br> <br>
				Also, even if you removed the side case, it's still not an even 50/50. Studies have shown that the initial face up side when flipped has a 51% chance of landing at the end compared to the measely 49% the initial face down side has. <br>
				Even worse, the coin is deterministic. If you could correctly calibrate the amount of force the coin receives, the amount of drag in the air, collision elasticity, and other factors, it will always land on the same side. <br> <br>
				Which brings the question, is life deterministic or free will? Determinism is the idea that everything in life is already planned out, as in, whenever you flip a coin, its variables are all generated by some omnipresent force to give exactly this response. Free will, on the other hand, argues that everything is truly random. The coin flip will truly give a 51/49 response every time and it is not decided by some magical force. <br>
				People have debated on this issue for a long time, but the horrifying or fun truth is, we will never know. <br> <br>
				But the true question is, how did all of this come from the act of flipping a coin? Human imagination is certainly weird. And creative.
