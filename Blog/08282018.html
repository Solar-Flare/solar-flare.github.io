			<h2>Procrastination - Social Media</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/28/2018</h5>
			<p>
				People, naturally, don't want to do things they dislike doing. After all, you get dopamine from doing addictive things like watching tv or playing games, which make you happier than doing that lousy history homework. <br> <br>
				Procrastination is what happens when you put aside things you have to do in favor of things you like to do, but are not what you have to do at the present moment. <br>
				According to a study, about 66% of all procrastination cases have people go to social media. Talking to other people, seeing what other people are doing. But when you are not on social media, you want to constantly check it. <br>
				This is defined as the fear of missing out, or FOMO, where at any point if you do not go on social media you feel left out of the social media community and thus there is the constant urge to check for any new updates or chat with basically anyone. <br>
				Experiments have shown that people get anxious whenever they hear social media sounds, and even more so if they cannot immediately check on it - proving the urge to check social media exists and consequently the urge to procrastinate via going on social media.<br> <br>
				And as an individual who constantly deals with procrastination, it is very hard to get started on working - after all, reading social media websites are far more enjoyable and fun. <br> <br>
				It at the end of the day boils down to whether or not you can suppress your desires. And of course, such is very difficult. As the human neural path takes about 90 days to reset, it will require 90 days of no impulse from that source to be free from the procrastination - and no one wants that. For instance, the biggest offender, social media, no one will be willing to quit social media basically forever - it is crucial to the identity for a lot of people, and there is the fear of missing out that drives people to always return. <br>
				So this isn't just a problem of quitting the source of procrastination - it is more of a psychological one. <br> <br>
