			<h2>Coming Up With Ideas</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/25/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Normally there comes a point when you do anything where you just don't know what to do next. Like when you're done with a really good book and can't find something similar. Or when you don't know how to solve a big looming problem that impedes your progress. <br> <br>

				A nice thing to do is to relax first, soften your brain up, and then come up with ideas, unless the problem is urgent. But if the problem is urgent, then maybe it's time management problems. <br> <br>
				There are a few easy ways to first relax. Relaxing your brain first eases your tension and allows you later on to better focus on the task at hand, helping your procedure in searching for that next book or looking for that key to the problem. Some things you can do include sleeping (a nice 8 hour sleep can seriously restart your mind and is helpful), meditating (just a nice 10 minutes to just put yourself back into where you are), or just doing what you like doing in your free time, be it walking outside, playing with toys, .etc. <br> <br>

				Once your brain is relieved of tension, it can better come up with ideas! But ideas don't just randomly walk into your brain and say 'hi'.  <br>
				Some things you can do include coming up with what would be the worst ideas to the problem at hand. Generally, there is value to terrible ideas - not only do they give you a general pattern of what not to think about, better focusing on what makes a good solution, but there may be hidden gems you previously discarded. <br>
				Another thing you can do is to think beyond the scope of what you like. If you need a new book, maybe you could pick up a movie instead. Maybe you don't really need to deal with the problem by not walking down this path at all. And so on. <br> <br>

				There are generally a lot of great ways to deal with the problem of 'what to do', but one of them is to not make 'what to do' as a solution, like I did with this blog post.
