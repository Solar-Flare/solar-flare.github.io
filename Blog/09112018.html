			<h2>65,537 and the Interesting Number Paradox</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/11/2018</h5>
			<p>
				65,537 is a pretty interesting number. It is currently the largest Fermat prime number known, which is a prime number that also happens to be a Fermat number which is a number expressed in the form 2^(2^n) + 1. If n is 4, then 2^4 is 16, and 2^16 is 65536, and plus one is 65,537. No other fermat numbers are currently known to be prime, which makes this number interesting. <br> <br>
				The largest n-gon constructible by a compass and ruler where n is odd also turns out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65537-gon#Construction">65537</a>. <br> <br>
				But the concept of 'interesting' depends wildly on perspective. Some may say 65,537 is not a very interesting number and there are more interesting ones (Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)">1729</a>). So there may exist varying degrees of 'interesting'. <br> <br>
				But, by definition ALL numbers must be interesting. <br>
				If 2 were the smallest unintersting number, that itself would make it interesting. Similarly, if there existed a set of uninteresting numbers, the first number of that list would become interesting by virtue of being the first uninteresting number. In other words, a set of uninteresting numbers cannot exist. <br> <br>
				In other words we should appreciate mathematics and every number that comes out of it because by sheer definition all numbers are interesting by default. This is the Interesting Number Paradox.
