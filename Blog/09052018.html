			<h2>Automatic vs Controlled Processes</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/05/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Try to type this message on this textbox: "Hello World". <br> <br>
				<input type="text"> <br> <br>
				Now, switch your hands positions (so right hand is on f and left hand is on j) and type it again here: <br> <br>
				<input type="text"> <br> <br>
				If you actually did it there would have been a very noticeable difference in the time elapsed to type that message. The first would have been a breeze; but the second task would have taken a very long time. <br>
				What is happening here is that we have been very used to typing with our left hand on the ASDF area while the right hand is on the JKL; area. By doing it repeatedly our brain has developed the neural pathways in our brain to instantly associate a letter to a position to one of our hands, and send a signal to our left or right hand to move and press that letter. <br> <br>
				In fact, it's so automatic that you probably can type entire words in less than a second; we just have been so used to typing like this that our brains have made the process instantaneously quickly. <br>Imagine in your first days of typing how quickly you typed. You likely would have been the pace of the second task. This is because we are trying to find the positions of the letters themselves first, then after spotting it, telling our brain where it is, and then the brain returns a signal to a hand telling it to press it. <br> <br>
				 By continuously typing, we have turned this self-conscious controlled process of individually identifying the position of a letter then sending a signal to type it, to an automatic process of instantly associating a letter to a position and effortlessly sending a signal to press it as soon as you think of it.
