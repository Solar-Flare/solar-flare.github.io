			<h2>Starting Things</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/22/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Normally the hardest thing in any adventure is the beginning. Take this blog for example. I've always wanted to start a site of my own just for the sake of fun and learning since 2016. </br>
				</br>
				Well, it's 2018. </br>
				</br>
				Of course, just because it's delayed doesn't necessarily mean that the idea will die off, nor does it mean that it will be delayed forever. Maybe something in life came up, and you have to attend to it first. Maybe you'd rather do other things first, then come back to it later. As long as you end up doing it in the end, it shouldn't matter whatsoever, like 60 year olds entering first grade.</br>
				</br>
				As I start a random journey to document my CS life, this is what I have learned. There is nothing to be ashamed of for starting things late, nor is there anything that will punish you (as long as they aren't some project due at some day of course). The first step is always the hardest, as they say. </br>
				</br>
				In fact, once I got the framework rolling, I found it easier to actually continue writing, so if you're on the fence too about starting something, you should. And see how it goes! Life is ultimately an adventure that you alongside 7 other billion players play, real-time, so just don't hesitate, really.</br>
				</br>
				I mean, if you don't like it you can always quit it in favor of something else, right? Hopefully that doesn't happen.
