			<h2>Dimensions</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/23/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Our world is a three-dimensional world operating through time which most scientists consider as the fourth. </br>
				That is, spacetime. </br>
				</br>
				Time is a really interesting concept, as you could really think of time as a dimension in itself. Imagine a line of boxes, with each box representing a unit of time (planck time) Then we would be travelling through the fourth dimension simply by existing: you reading this sentence would have hurled you more than a million of these frames! </br>
				</br>
				This has interesting applications for the fifth dimension. The multiverse theory in essence would be a fifth dimension as all possibilities are a 'fourth dimension' and compiling it onto a plane would be the multiverse. </br>
				</br>
				But that's not the only possible definition of dimensions. As the first four dimensions (0, 1, 2, 3) are all geometric, can't it be the case that the 4th dimension is also geometric in nature as well? This would be impossible to visualize to us, but that is because our vision is 3 dimensional, and our concept of space and geometry come from our eyesights. </br>
				</br>
				Perhaps the biggest reason though why most consider time as the 4th dimension is it is easily perceivable; we can't exactly even hypothesize how 4th dimension will work. </br>
				On the other hand, mathematically 4th dimension being geometric makes the most sense, as we denote direction in geometry via (x, y, z) so it makes sense for the fourth dimension to be in the form (x, y, z, a). </br>
				</br>
				At the end of the day, there are many dimensions to the argument 'what is the fourth dimension?'.
