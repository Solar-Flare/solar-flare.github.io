			<h2>Technological Singularity</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/30/2018</h5>
			<p>
				1943, the first computer spanning multiple rooms were created. <br>
				Back then, no one really knew what this would lead to. <br> <br>

				Now, the one you are using to read this is probably a million times faster than you at calculations. <br>
				And this speed of technological growth will only accelerate. <br> <br>

				At one point, humanity will most likely create a technological singularity. This is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial intelligence will cause the AI to grow in an extremely fast rate, surpassing the rate of humans' technological growth. This will eventually cause the AI to dominate all technological fields and become a technological singularity, while all of humans' roles are wiped out as technology does everything better than humans. <br> <br>

				As much as this is concerning, however, and there are pacts between countries to never develop AI, there is just too much incentive to create one, and it seems likely that one day, there will be one and we will become quite literally useless. Is it a good thing? Perhaps we were destined to create a technological overlord. Or perhaps all of our technological research is going to lead nowhere and AI will never be created. <br> <br>
				Hopefully, however, we will never see the day of AI running rampant in our society.
