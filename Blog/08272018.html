			<h2>Memories</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/27/2018</h5>
			<p>
				It's true that everyone has only one life. And at the end of it, you die. That's how pretty much everyone lives will go except a couple of cryogenically frozen people. <br> <br>
				And biologically, most people don't differ a lot except for a couple silent mutations here and there. <br>
				There are ultimately two fundamental differences between people and other people: physical attributes, and memories. <br> <br>
				In this post I want to talk about the latter. Your own set of experiences, and memories derived from such, are completely unique. Not to mention the memories that you have imprinted on other people. This makes you significant from a mathematical perspective: no person will ever have the same set of experiences as you do, and the idea of uniqueness makes you significant.<br> <br>
				But besides the mathematical perspective, memories themselves define who you are, alongside your genetics. The memories serve as your environment, and has an impact on your psychology and overall how you act to things. If you have a memory of getting injured on sandpaper, you won't attempt to do whatever you were doing with the sandpaper again.<br>
				But it is true that if you're sad you tend to think of sad memories while if you're happy you tend to think of happy memories (the state-dependent memory). This means that what you're thinking of is literally a glimpse into your current mood state! <br>
				And so these precious mind bubbles aren't just things that embarass you from time to time, but they're also a part of you, and guide you through similar scenarios!
