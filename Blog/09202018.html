			<h2>Entropy, Heat Death (UD Part 1)</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/20/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Part 1 of Universe Death Series as illustrated <a href="08242018.html">here</a>. <br> <br>

				According to the second law of thermodynamics, nothing is ever 100% efficient. Not all electricity that goes into the screen you are reading this from is used to display this webpage; some of it is lost as friction via rubbing against the wire while travelling to your screen, some of it is lost as heat radiated from your screen, etc. <br> <br>

				This increases a value called 'entropy', or a state of disorder. This can be thought of as 'heat' for the purposes of this explanation. <br>
				Because nothing can be over 100% efficient, as a result, entropy or heat can never decrease. Even a machine made to absorb heat would actually ironically generate more heat! Like ACs, for instance. <br> <br>
				This means that over time, the overall temperature of the universe will slowly increase as entropy starts piling up. And as no space in the universe is isolated from all other spaces (disregarding black holes as even they will decay over time...), the universe will turn into a massive hot energy ball over time, causing a 'heat death' with no more physical phenomena.
