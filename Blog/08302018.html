			<h2>Probabilities Part 2 - Cards</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/30/2018</h5>
			<p>
				A deck of cards have 52 cards. If you were to shuffle them and place them on a pile, they are probably a deck of cards in a order that is never before seen in the entire universe. <br>
				Of course, this sounds insane. There are only 52 cards in a deck and there are multiple millions of people that play cards and have shuffled the deck many times in their life. So how can this be? <br> <br>
				What do you think the total number of ways to order a deck of 52 cards are? 1 million? 10 million? Maybe a billion or even a trillion? <br>
				Mathematically, the total number of ways to order a deck of cards is 52 factorial. This is 8.06 times 10 to the 67... Or 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000. <br> <br>
				In comparison, ever since the big bang, the universe had a total of a mere 4.35 times 10 to the 17 seconds! A deck being a new composition of 52 cards thus is (total number of existing compositions) / 8.06 * 10^67, which is still probably well over 99%. <br> <br>

				Even if there are an astronomically large number of something (in this case all known shuffles of the deck in the entire universe), if there is an even astronomically larger number (all possible shuffles), it doesn't matter if the number is still incomprehensibly large, it is completely dwarfed by an even large number and is reduced to insignificance. <br> <br>
