				Practically speaking, beyond 3.1415926535 can be discarded in our day-to-day lives as it is inconsequential, it will almost never be needed. But even if its really useless in daily lives, why do people still bother to research deep into irrational numbers like pi or e? <br>
				<br>
				There definitely is a use to a precise pi, for instance astrophysicists. Even if unrelated to pi, a miscalculation or imprecision can cause complete failure of landings for instance. So having that very precise measure can definitely be helpful to STEM fields... to a degree. <br> 
				The thing is, the record for most decimal places of pi calculated have been steadily increasing, as recently as 2016 November, when 22 trillion digits of pi were calculated. <br>
				For context, having a document with 22 trillion 'b's has a size of 22,000 gigabytes. That's 200 laptop's worth of storage space, which is downright bonkers.
				<br> <br>
				Will anyone who need precise calculations ever need all that 22 trillion digits of precision? I don't even think they would use 1000 digits, let alone 22 trillion. So after the 10,000 mark, what even is the point of calculating beyond that?
				<br> <br>
				Math isn't just about solving problems, in fact in my perspective it's the exact opposite. Math is about being curious about patterns in the real world, and irrational numbers are a pattern of its own. People are not calculating 22 trillion digits of pi to solve any kind of problem, but the problem of 'what does 22 trillion digits of pi look like?' The digits ultimately are just a satiation to the curiosity of people, and people will solve these kinds of problems because they can - and it's fun to them.
