			<h2>Blue Part 1</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/01/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Our eyes work by receiving light waves from outer sources. It then converts the light waves into signals that our brain then processes as signals. <br>

				Light waves are given off from literally everything around you. Those same things also give off radiation of other kinds like gamma radiation, but our eyes do not detect it. As a result, the light that our eyes can pick up are called light waves or visible waves while those that can't are in other categories like microwaves or gamma waves.<br> <br>

				Why do some things emit red waves while some things emit blue waves, then? Things aren't constantly changing color but are stable. A tomato is red because it absorbs all other wavelengths of visible light but reflect red waves into your eye. But where is the red wave coming from? <br> <br>

				There is usually a light source that shows you that the color is red. In a dark room, you would not be able to tell what color a tomato is. But because the light source emits white light to the tomato, and the tomato absorbs all but red light, that is the color you see a tomato as. <br> <br>

				<a href="09032018.html">...But then why is the sky blue? Light waves actually just straightly pass through and are relatively unaffected, so shouldn't it have no color?</a>
