			<h2>Precision and Accuracy</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/29/2018</h5>
			<p>
				What is precision and accuracy in a scientific context? <br>
				For instance, lets say that a research study, labelled A, finds that there is 60.5% silicon in gummy bears. Another research study, labelled B, finds that there is 39.99999999% silicon in gummy bears. <br> <br>

				Precision is a measure of how many significant digits there are in a number. Simply put, each non-zero digit is a significant digit and all zeros at the end of a number to the right of the decimal point. 39.99999999% would be more precise than 60.5% due to its large array of significant digits. <br> <br>

				As we all know the true value of silicon in gummy bears is 100%, we can evaluate the accuracy of the two research studies. That is, how close the result values are to the real value. In this scenario, A is more accurate than B because 60.5 is closer to 100 than 39.99999999. <br> <br>

				And lastly, sorry for all gummy bear enthusiasts and haters, but the two research studies are completely, totally false.
