			<h2>Importance and Nihilism</h2>
			<h5>Date: 08/24/2018</h5>
			<p>
				There are three ways this universe can end according to the collective knowledge we have so far: <br>
				Big Crunch, <br>
				Big Rip, <br>
				And the Heat Death. <br>
				<br>
				But what they are is a subject for another blog post. One of these inevitably will occur in the distant future, at least according to our knowledge so far. <br>
				What does this mean? The world and anything you have done will one day have all traces of it erased. Nothing will remain in the end. <br>
				<br>
				So why bother doing them? Is what a pessimist nihilist says. And only does things that he wants to do to maximize his enjoyment as nothing truly has meaning in the end so might as well.
				<br>
				<br>
				But it also means that nothing will matter! What anyone thinks you're doing has any matter in what you're doing. So this thought could mean you becomes far more energetic and do things people will consider weird just because you want to do it. It also means that life would be an adventure will many unknowns. This is an optimist nihilist. <br>
				<br>
				As a nihilist who thinks both ways on and off, I do think it's sometimes stigmatized as a bunch of no-energy people who don't do things and don't believe in anything, but that's not really true, it just means that we perceive the endings of this timeline differently and not much can differ, surprisingly. <br> <br>
				There's no correct philosophy to live in and most people aren't a nihilist in the first place. After all, it's your life. But the point of this blog post is to show two perspectives of emphasizing importance, and there would be many others. <br>
				<br>
				But there is no correct philosophy to live in, as stated earlier, so that's an adventure of its own kind, to figure out others' perspectives! How do you perceive importance in things? <br>
