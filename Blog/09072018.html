			<h2>False Beliefs</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/07/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Do People use only 10 percent of their brains? Do you eat on average 8 spiders in your sleep in a year? Does swallowed gum stay in you for 7 years? <br> <br>

				If you thought the answer to any of them were yes, then you were probably influenced by people and the internet around you, as they are all false. <br>
				There are a couple of problems that make people believe things that are factually incorrect. This includes the availability heuristic and emotions. <br>
				Do people get killed by terrorists or cars more often?  The availability heuristic is a shortcut to questions like the one above that relies on immediate examples that come to mind. While the former is more vivid and more likely to be stored in your mind than car accidents, alongside news reporting terrorists far more often, in reality people die by cars far more often than terrorists. It as a result can make one believe in false beliefs like people dying by terrorists more than cars - simply because it is more readily available in the mind than car accidents. <br> <br>

				Our emotions are a powerful factor in believing false things. The 8 spiders in sleep per year plays on the idea of fear, and if one is already controlled in the emotional side of things, it is more likely for the individual to accept that it is true and take precautions to stop it, as logical reasoning is diminished when one's emotions have taken over. <br > <br>

				But it is true that these tools that make us believe in false beliefs are also those that have been necessary to our survival, so it's like a double-edged sword in many ways.
