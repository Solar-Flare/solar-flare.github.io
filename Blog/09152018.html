			<h2>The Free Will Debate</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/15/2018</h5>
			<p>
				There's always been a recurring question throughout life: 'Are our decisions in our control?' <br><br>
				What if our decisions to do anything are impeded? As in, is it already predetermined you will wake up at 9 AM today, or did we truly decide for ourselves that we will wake up now? <br>
				Normally, we would presume that we do indeed have free will. After all, everything we've done, we've consciously thought about it, right? But that may just be an illusion. We may just be 'tricked' into thinking we are deciding something, when the universe already decided what you will decide on. <br> <br> <Br>

				These are the two sides of the free will debate. And scientifically, both sides do exist. <br> <br>
				Those who believe in determinism argue that if you have enough information about a situation, you can predict any future event with perfect precision. Which tends to be pretty true; a lot of information can allow one to analyze situations, people's tendencies, to calculate methodically what will probably happen. <br>
				This, however, isn't always exactly true. Human emotions tend to be really spontaneous, irrational, and may cause people to do things that break the rational information predictions. <br> <br>
				On the other hand, the free will argument can be made by simply looking at quantum mechanics. At the subatomic level, particles are truly random on where they can be, and with it, pulses that confer what to do will also be random and not pre-calculate-able, making your decisions truly your own. 
				But does small shifts in particle movements have a huge impact on decisions? <br> <br>
				At the end of the day, both sides are valid, as there is no defined answer - only you and all other individuals individually can decide that for yourselves.
