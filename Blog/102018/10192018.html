			<h2>Correlation/Causation</h2>
			<h5>Date: 10/19/2018</h5>
			<p>
				About the pause between 10/2 to 10/19, this time period was kind of a terrible time period for me. Everyone really goes through one of those, though, and now I finally have time to do more brain dumps. <br> <br>
				Anyways, there are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics. The former two are self explanatory, but the third one is the interesting one. <br>
				What does it mean by statistics being a 'lie'? <br> <br>
				If you go to this <a href="http://tylervigen.com/old-version.html">site</a>, you will see a bunch of graphs that tend to follow very similar patterns. And according to statistics, that is showing correlation, as in, two sets of data are very closely similar or has a casual relationship; in other words the sets of data follow a similar pattern. <br> <br>
				Many statistics makes it seem like correlation means one causes the other. And that's an implied bias - if two sets of data follow a similar pattern, one ought to cause another, right? In other words, causation. <br> <br>
				Observe the first graph in the site above. It shows a set of data that represents US spending on science, space, and technology, and a set of data that represents suicides by hanging/strangulation/suffocation, and the data sets are very correlated; both go up at a similar rate. <br> <br>
				But how does US spending on science/space/tech increase suicides by hanging/strangulation/suffocation? It just can't be explained (maybe if the increase was small we could attribute it to alien technology). <br> <br>
				The reason for this is simply because an increase in population increases suicide count and also increases the GDP of the US - in other words, correlation doesn't imply causation.
