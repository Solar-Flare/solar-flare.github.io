			<h2>Dark Energy, Big Rip (UD Part 3)</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/23/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Part 3 of Universe Death Series as illustrated <a href="08242018.html">here</a>. <br> <br>

				The Big Crunch theory suggests that over time, things will slow down and stop moving, and then slowly move towards each other and form a singularity. <br> <br>

				Well, unfortunately, things are actually moving away at an accelerating rate. The nearest galaxies are actually slowly moving further away from us, and the 'slowing down' seems to be non-existent. <br> <br>

				Perhaps the galaxies gained too much energy from the Big Bang, and over time it'll follow the Big Crunch theory. Or... <br> <br>

				Scientists have coined a term 'Dark Energy' for a mysterious energy of the universe that propels things away from each other. It is called 'Dark Energy' because we don't know if it exists, as it's not observable. <br>

				We don't know if this Dark Energy is strong enough to slowly rip the fabric of spacetime apart, as we don't know what it is. But if the dark energy were hypothetically strong enough, it would first pull all galaxies far away from each other, and slowly, star systems will be pulled away from each other, then planets will be pulled away from their stars as the Dark Energy rips everything away from each other. <br> <br>
				Eventually, all quarks and leptons will be ripped from each other, and there will be nothing left in the universe. This is the Big Rip.
