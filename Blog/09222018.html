			<h2>Gravitation, Big Crunch (UD Part 2)</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/21/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Part 2 of Universe Death Series as illustrated <a href="08242018.html">here</a>. <br> <br>

				Gravity pulls all things with mass together. You are attracting the sun right now, and so is a tiny electron, and the earth is pulling you towards it, allowing us to stay on the surface and never leave. <br> <br> <br>
				When the Big Bang occurred, everything ejected in all directions at massive velocities. <br> <br>
				But even as they were moving away from each other, they only had one acceleration: gravity. And theoretically, if the stellar objects are not moving at a fast enough speed, eventually gravity will stop it to a halt. And then the objects will start moving towards each other. <br> <br>

				Eventually all the matter will gravitate towards the center of the universe, and generate another singularity. This is the Big Crunch. <br> <br>

				This is also the only theoretical universe ending that supports multiple universes in the same timeline! As a big bang of the singularity created our universe as is currently, and this ending creates another singularity, it is plausible that it will explode again, creating a whole new universe! <br> <br>

				Or it can just stay there and be a good singularity. It can do whatever it wants, right?
