			<h2>Escapism/Addiction</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/17/2018</h5>
			<p>
				Everyone tends to have something they like doing. Be it a game, music, art, solving problems, and so on. But every now and then, we lose interest in things, we want to escape into more interesting hobbies instead. The notion of running away from the dull lives we have into a supposedly fascinating medium is escapism. <br> <br>
				Like, watching television shows all day long, even when you need to do boring tasks at life. <br> <br>
				A common cause of slipping your hobbies and doing less interesting but more enjoyable tasks include the fact that some daily tasks tend to give slow results or rewards and lack of determination. <br> <br>
				Addiction is formed when one's brain's dopamine outburst becomes a crave, especially when normalized into nothingness. When we constantly get dopamine outburst from television, for instance, we tend to crave that outburst when we're not watching television. When your daily lives are boring, and a medium promises to give you a lot of dopamine, you're more bound to start getting that dopamine overload in your brain and become addicted, causing escapism. <br> <br>
				People can often feel discouraged when doing their hobbies. This can include whenever they constantly make mistakes. When one is frustrated often when they make mistakes, they would want to start wanting perfect alternatives. Television and other media will never go wrong - they are perfect, which captures these kinds of people perfectly. Of course, there will be people who like the mistakes and challenge, but a lot of people get put down easily from mistakes. <br> <br>
