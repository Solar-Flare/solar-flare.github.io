			<h2>Solar Flares</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/09/2018</h5>
			<p>
				This meta nonsense aside, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ASolar_Blast.ogv">a solar flare</a> is actually a really cool phenomena. It involves a sudden flash of brightness, often near the surface. It is typically caused by the magnetic energy built up by the atmopshere's  interactions with charged particles like electrons. It tends to be like an ejection of energy, generating a lot of light in the process. <br> <br>
				The total amount of energy and light generated comes out to be somewhere between 1E20 and 1E25 Joules. This is still a really massive amount of energy; the amount of energy required to keep a 60 watt lightbulb running for an hour for instance is only 216,000 J. This is also why it's called a solar flare; the sheer amount of light generated act much like a flare that happens very briefly before fizzling. <br> <br>
				The reason why I named this site after this phenomena is because if every single thing in a human body were transformed into energy and released, 7.2E19 Joules would be released, almost the energy of a single solar flare. I tend to be more of a optimistic nihilist, and the idea that I have ~80 years to shine radiantly however so I choose, in a quick flash, is how I portray my life. Much like a solar flare. But it also works for my pessimistic nihilist view. The fact that this energy will fizzle out after that flash, and nothing is left behind that shows the flare did happen, at least visually, is indictive of the inevitable doom. <br> <br> <br>

				But at the end of the day, I just really like flashy things.
