			<h2>Blue Part 2</h2>
			<h5>Date: 09/03/2018</h5>
			<p>
				The atmosphere has air particles. While most of the red, orange, yellow and the other longer wavelengths mostly pass through the air with no change, the wavelengths of the blue spectrum are often absorbed by the air particles, and then released into the air as radiation. The sky appears blue because this exact radiated blue light is what reaches your eyes. But nearer the horizon there is more distance meaning more blue radiation is released in a different direction. This is because the air particles in the way will absorb it and release it in a different direction! <br> <br>

				This explains some other phenomena. Why is the sky red in a sunset? This is because the light now directly goes towards your eyes from the sun, and less of the blue wavelengths, making the sky a reddish one. <br> <br>

				Why is the space black? There is no air to 'reflect' the wavelengths of the light source back into your eyes, so there is no light. Black is the abscence of light, so that is why space is black.
