				<h2><a href="Blog/102018/10192018.html">Correlation/Causation</a></h2>
				<h5>Date: 10/19/2018</h5>
				<p>
				About the pause between 10/2 to 10/19, this time period was kind of a terrible time period for me. Everyone really goes through one of those, though, and now I finally have time to do more brain dumps. <br> <br>
				Anyways, there are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics. The former two are self explanatory, but the third one is the interesting one. <br>
				What does it mean by statistics being a 'lie'? <br> <br>
				If you go to this <a href="http://tylervigen.com/old-version.html">site</a>, you will see a bunch of graphs that tend to follow very similar patterns. And according to statistics, that is showing correlation, as in, two sets of data are very closely similar or has a casual relationship; in other words the sets of data follow a similar pattern. <br> <br>
				Many statistics makes it seem like correlation means one causes the other. And that's an implied bias - if two sets of data follow a similar pattern, one ought to cause another, right? In other words, causation. <br> <br>
				Observe the first graph in the site above. It shows a set of data that represents US spending on science, space, and technology, and a set of data that represents suicides by hanging/strangulation/suffocation, and the data sets are very correlated; both go up at a similar rate. <br> <br>
				But how does US spending on science/space/tech increase suicides by hanging/strangulation/suffocation? It just can't be explained (maybe if the increase was small we could attribute it to alien technology). <br> <br>
				The reason for this is simply because an increase in population increases suicide count and also increases the GDP of the US - in other words, correlation doesn't imply causation.

				<h2> <a href="Blog/102018/10022018.html">Experimentation </a></h2>
				<h5>Date: 10/02/2018</h5>
				<p>
					There have been a lot of people thinking about all kinds of crazy theories to phenomena in the world out there, like 'Is our world flat'. Some theories have people really believing it to be true. But why are these theories actually theories? And how do we consciously reject certain theories? <br> <br>
					Some people may believe our world is flat. But just look at photos of the Earth from the ISS. Or, if the world was indeed flat, where does the sun come from? Does it erupt out of the flat earth, or is there some 'boundary' that should a person walk over, they fall down into an abyss? <br> <br>
					Gravity too in a sense helps explain why the world can't be flat. All other celestial bodies are round because a central gravitating point pulls matters equally in all directions, generating that round shape. <br> <br>
					This entire process of trying out theories (or the disproving of such), testing them against the world, obtaining results and observations is the process of experimentation. That experiment in school where you drop a ball and measure the gravitational constant of Earth? You are using measurement tools to measure and test, multiple times, the world and its constraints to find out how gravity works. <br> <br>
					I decided to change the format of this blog, too, because I wanted to experiment if changing the style would make a difference to how I view this tiny project of mine. That in itself is a testing on the world, namely myself. I think it won't, but oh well.
