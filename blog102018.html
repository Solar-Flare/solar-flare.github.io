			<h5>Date: 10/02/2018</h5>
			<p>
				There have been a lot of people thinking about all kinds of crazy theories to phenomena in the world out there, like 'Is our world flat'. Some theories have people really believing it to be true. But why are these theories actually theories? And how do we consciously reject certain theories? <br> <br>
				Some people may believe our world is flat. But just look at photos of the Earth from the ISS. Or, if the world was indeed flat, where does the sun come from? Does it erupt out of the flat earth, or is there some 'boundary' that should a person walk over, they fall down into an abyss? <br> <br>
				Gravity too in a sense helps explain why the world can't be flat. All other celestial bodies are round because a central gravitating point pulls matters equally in all directions, generating that round shape. <br> <br>
				This entire process of trying out theories (or the disproving of such), testing them against the world, obtaining results and observations is the process of experimentation. That experiment in school where you drop a ball and measure the gravitational constant of Earth? You are using measurement tools to measure and test, multiple times, the world and its constraints to find out how gravity works. <br> <br>
				I decided to change the format of this blog, too, because I wanted to experiment if changing the style would make a difference to how I view this tiny project of mine. That in itself is a testing on the world, namely myself. I think it won't, but oh well.
