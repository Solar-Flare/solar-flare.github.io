      Welcome to the tiny blog I ran in version 1.0 of this blog!
      Yeah, I guess, some things are better left unfinished.
      Kind of sad that I stopped working on this because I actually loved writing this.
      Why did I stop? Because I have too much on my plate lately to work on this...
      Oh wells. Enjoy! <br>
      Todo: Add a sidebar to make this mess a little more readable

    <h2>Running in Circles (Circuits Part 1)</h2>
    <h5>Date: 03/03/2019</h5>
    <p>
      So circuits are shocking little designs that electrify devices, even the very screen you are reading this blog post on. But what exactly is a circuit and how does it do this? <br> <br>

      A circuit is a closed path which a electrical current can flow. An electrical current is defined as the movement of electrons; so in other words a circuit is simply a race track that electrons run around on. <br> <br>

      But that's pretty misleading. Imagine instead that this electrical circular race track is full of electrons; and one of them is pushed forward. This is basically like dominoes falling down in rapid succession; while the electron/domino itself is slow, it's the forward propulsion of momentum to other electron/dominoes that make electrical currents travel almost instantaneously in a circuit with almost no resistance. <br> <br>

      This electrical circuit ultimately carries with it a force (usually done through batteries; electrons are attracted to the positive end of the battery and so will move towards it, doing that push described earlier) which can then be utilized... for other things.

    <h2>Planck Length</h2>
    <h5>Date: 02/25/2019</h5>
    <p>
      There exists a minimum distance we can possible measure: The Planck Length. It is about 1.616 * 10^-35 meters in length. But why is it that we can't observe, say, 1.4 * 10^-35 meters? <br> <br>

      Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is an answer to this concept. It states that several properties of a particle has innate uncertainties tying them together. One such pair is location and momentum. The principle states that the uncertainty in location times the uncertainty in momentum is equal to or greater than the Planck Constant. <br> <br>

      Suppose you tried to measure a particle's location so accurately down to the planck length and beyond. This makes the uncertainty in location extremely small. Consequently, since the equation must hold, the uncertainty in momentum becomes so large. Since this means its velocity, and consequently its energy, also has a high uncertainty, this results in such a massive energy 'burst' that the particle that is trying to be observed at the planck length level to immediately collapse into a miniature black hole, unable to observe beyond this fundamental unit of length. <br> <br>

      In other words, if you want to ruin somebody's day, just observe their shirt down to the 1.616 * 10^-35 meter level.

    </p>
    <br> <br>

    <h2>Dark Matter</h2>
    <h5>Date: 02/03/2019</h5>
    <p>
      Gravity pulls everything in the universe together. Like, you and the screen you are reading on is being pulled together at a negligible amount. Or the sun and Sirius A. <br>

      They also make things like galaxies work - a massive center (normally a large black hole) pulls everything in a sphere, spiral, or other shapes a galaxy exists in. Well, there was one problem. When people measured the amount of matter we can detect in a galaxy, they found out that the current amount of mass they saw in the galaxies do not impose enough gravitational attraction to keep them together. In other words, theoretically they should fly apart. <br> <br>

      So why are they not? <br>
      Some people theorize a 'dark matter' that is the most likely scenario that accounts for this low gravitational attraction. A normal galaxy's mass required for all of its parts to stay in the galactical shape is ten times the amount that we observe within a galaxy. This means there is an undetectable, large amount of this dark matter that allows this gravitational attraction to work. <br> <br>

      Some think this matter is something we've never seen before. Some think this is brown dwarfs - a very hard to detect small faint star that doesn't have the mass to chain-react nuclear fusion. It can also be comets, or rogue cold planets not attached to any star, or even a miscalculation of black hole's masses.

    <h2>2019!</h2>
    <h5>Date: 01/20/2019</h5>
    <p>
      2019 is a relatively bland number. It's just 3 times 673. <br>

      So focusing 20 and 19 instead, because they're both fun. <br> <br>

      <h3> 19 </h3>
      <br>
      19 is the 8th prime number. (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19) <br>
      19 is also the lowest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_triangular_number">centered triangular number</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_hexagonal_number">centered hexagonal number.</a> <br>
      19 is also the 7th Mersenne Prime exponent.
      <br> <br>
      <h3> 20 </h3>
      20 is 2x2x5. <br>
      ANY 3x3x3 Rubiks cube can be solved under 20 moves (Quarter or half turns). <br>
      20 is also a tetrahedral number. <br>
      Icosahedron has 20 faces, while a dodecahedron has 20 verticies. <br>

      <br> <br>
      So at the end of the day, 2019 itself is boring, but its components are fun. Just like how the time of 2019 is boring, but the components, us, will have exciting futures!
      Or something like that.

    <h2>Random Mini Rants 2</h2>
    <h5>Date: 12/14/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Yay, universities. <br>
      The Asian Parents' sole goal of life, and the one thing that high schools enslave themselves over. <br>
      In some ways, this toxic thought process grew over the fact that people have figured out what colleges want, and this push for getting into good colleges grew and grew until stats now are so atomically high that you wonder if some kids should even be going into colleges. <br>
      In a way, this is perpetuated by the fact that people want to get in, and demand rises, which means low supply and high costs -> economics! <br> <br>

      On the subject of dimensions <br>

      A dimension is really just a way of expressing vectors. Like, a 1 dimension expresses vectors in 1 direction. <br>
      (5) describes a vector going 5 in the positive axis, while (-2) describes a vector going 2 in the negative axis, for instance. <br>
      You can add more dimensions! Our current world is comprehended in 3 geometric dimensions (and time but we're just gonna ignore that), and a point in this world can be expressed as a vector from the origin to the point! <br>
      If you had a point at (2,3,8), then the vector (2,3,8) for instance would map this point out using the 3 dimensions given. <br>
      In other words, a means of defining 4, 5, 6... dimensions is found as a result; we just don't comprehend it yet. Or maybe we do. Some theoreticals have been done but so far we have yet to see a real 4D world (not including time) in action.
    </p>
    <br> <br>

    <h2>Dimensions, Part 2, Part 1</h2>
    <h5>Date: 12/09/2018</h5>
    <p>
      The Big Bang was undoubtedly one of the craziest events that allowed our universe to be where it is currently: A c o n s t a n t l y e x p a n d i n g sphere of happiness. <br>
      Or solemness. Whatever floats your boat. <br> <br>

      Within the singularity contained the four fundamental forces fused into a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">grand unified force</a> that split into the four forces we know today (theoretically could be five with electricity and magnetism splitting off). <br> <br>

      A main theory that pervades physics today, however, suggests that forces weren't the only thing that broke off with the advent of the Big Bang. The superstring theory, that every particle is merely a vibration of a string that subsides at the entire universe, requires 10 possible dimensions. <br> <br>
      Why does our universe only have 4 dimensions, then? (3 for geometric and time being the 4th dimension) Because the big bang forced a split of the dimensions into the 4 dimensions that make up the universe, and 6 dimensions, that might be anything. Some theories suggest it's infinitessimally small that make up particles, and other theories suggest we're living in a universe that is in itself a part of some other large puzzle. <br>
      Either way, the developments in these fields are certainly interesting.

    <h2>Normality</h2>
    <h5>Date: 11/20/2018</h5>
    <p>
      There are probably a lot of people out there you would consider 'weird'. Like, their actions seem off, their entire body screams 'I'm weird', and things like that. <br> <br>
      Even if there wasn't a person you consider that way, what exactly is 'weird'? Google defines 'weird' as 'bizarre, strange' but those words in term mean 'hard to understand or unsettling'. <br>
      This implies that if everyone in the universe except you turned into those people that you consider weird, people will find you hard to understand and find you weird, and their definition of normal becomes the norm! <br> <br>
      So what exactly is 'weird' and 'normal'? At the end of the day, those terms are societally defined as that's what precisely defines 'hard to understand'. What everyone thinks as okay are the ones that are normal and actions that people normally not do are naturally, as a result, the 'weird' ones. <br> <br>

      But nothing is ever binary. Nothing is ever black or white. <br> <br>

      Some things are not weird enough to be considered at the weird category but at the same time is not exactly easy to understand, either. Take scratching your neck. It's not considered normal, but I doubt a lot of people will find that to be 'weird'. <br> <br>

      Which brings up a third perspective to this thought process... Other people's definitions of 'normal' and 'weird' are naturally not the same as yours. I may believe that neck scratching is not weird enough and is not normal enough, but some people might find it to be excessively weird. Which one is the societal definition tends to be what the majority thinks. <br> <br>

      But at the end of the day, does it really matter all that much, though?
    </p>
    <br> <br>

    <h2>Binomial Tests</h2>
    <h5>Date: 11/18/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you get data that you are skeptical of its validity. Like, if you were running an experiment and you found out that 30% of people who receive coke receive alcohol poisoning, while 100% of people who receive water receive alcohol poisoning.
      <br>
      There's actually a lot of statistical techniques to solve that problem! One of them is the binomial test.
      <br> <br>
      In any experiment, a hypothetical 'average' that the data would reflect on would usually exist. You expect A to be around 8%. You expect those who drink water to receive alcohol poisoning 2% of the time. Using the total sample and total population, you can calculate whether the results of the experiment are valid or not! <br> <br>
      A binomial test inputs the probability, sample size and sample's result to determine the probability of the result occurring. In the above example, say we fed 200 people coke, and 60 of them received alcohol poisoning. Also hypothetically assume that coke has a 1% chance of giving someone alcohol poisoning (psst it's actually 100%) <br>
      This means that <a href="https://mathcracker.com/mean-standard-deviation-binomial-distribution.php">the mean is 2 people and standard deviation is 1.4 people</a>. 60 people, from the experiment, means that the experiment's results is over 40 standard deviations from the mean! It's probability of occurring hence is infinitessimally small (less than 1 * 10^-10% actually). Subsequently, it is unreliable and thus the experiment's results can be thrown out the window. <br> <br>
      Normally if the result's probability of occurring is at least 5%, then it is significant enough for the experiment to be considered valid. But otherwise, like the example above, means that rethinking the experiment's procedure and removal of the poisoned bodies is necessary. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Wave Function 2</h2>
    <h5>Date: 11/14/2018</h5>
    <p>
      One wave strand should not cause an interference pattern! <br> <br>
      Unless... <br> <br>
      One wave strand acts like all wave strands! <br>
      For as long as a photon is not observed, the pattern emitted will be an interference one, due to the wave function. The wave function is a function that determines where a particle is located. So if a photon was for sure going to be at (0, 0), then it's wave function will equal 1 at (0,0) and 0 at everywhere else. <br>
      But if a photon can be at (0,0) with a 75% probability and (0,1) with a 25% probability, then its wave function will match accordingly. As a photon entering the interference board can be at any point, these probability strands are the ones that interfere and thus a interference pattern will occur, albeit hyper paradoxically. <br> <br>
      This requires zero observation, however, as once the photon is observed, the wave function collapses immediately and the photon receives a definite location (can be (0,0) or (0,1) with the given probabilities, but only present at 1 point than at both points). Thus, observing it will remove the interference pattern and you will get a single moving point.

    <h2>Random Mini Rants 1</h2>
    <h5>Date: 11/8/2018</h5>
    <p>
      (Not an academic post, just random rants I wanted to go off for no reason at all) <br> <br>
      1. Grades <br>
      Honestly, I don't understand the massive stigma around getting good grades. I mean, yes, people should strive to achieve well in their classes at all levels. But sacrificing your sanity and sleep to boost grade by 1%? Crying so hard because of getting a 92 on a quiz? <br>
      Maybe people value that more than their personal lives, or maybe its because they intentionally pressure themselves into performing better. I'm not sure what the reason is, and there probably are outliers to this, but generally, I question the value of sacrificing your well being for an arbitrary point that may not make a difference, if any. <br> <br>
      2. Media <br>
      What happens when only one person dictates what you hear from the outside world? Not that that's a big deal or anything, but if a person says 'A' and that's all you hear, maybe you'll be inclined to believe only 'A' is correct and there are no other beliefs. Similarly, people who only hear 'B' are more likely to believe in only 'B'. I just think people should be willing to listen to all sides rather than shut off certain media just because they have a different opinion, because polarity results in distrust which results in exploitation which results in so many disastrous things, and I'd rather live than be forced to fight in another world war. <br> <br>
      3. Dihydrogen Monoxide <br>
      I'm not sure why we drink <a href="http://dhmo.org/facts.html">this</a>. I mean, according to what it says, we drink this so much and in reality it's so dangerous to us. Yay government led conspiracies. <br>
      (Please don't kill me this one is a joke) <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Infrared</h2>
    <h5>Date: 11/6/2018</h5>
    <p>
      All wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not part of the visible section are, frankly, not visible. Since they're not visible, how do we know they exist? <br>
      An experiment in trying to figure out the heat of different wavelengths did that. Before, all that was known was that white light would disperse into the different colors due to diffraction when given a narrow slit. An experimenter used a couple of thermometers to measure the temperatures at points struck by red light, yellow light, .etc. and had a few 'control' thermometers not being hit by the colors. <br> <br>
      What ended up happening instead was that the thermometer next to the red light thermometer read an abnormally higher temperature! <br> <br>
      This when experimented upon led to the discovery of infrared and ultraviolet waves, where 'infra' means below and 'ultra' means above, so infrared is below red in the EM spectrum and ultraviolet is above violet in the spectrum.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <h2>Wave Function 1</h2>
    <h5>Date: 11/4/2018</h5>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">Double-Slit Experiment</a> was an experiment used to measure the effect of diffraction on white light. Putting only two narrow openings from a light source to a surface, the experiment aimed to measure the effects of diffraction. After all, white light are made up of color waves like red waves (700 nm) to purple waves (400 nm), and according to how diffraction works, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Double_slit_interference.png">higher wavelengths (red) result in being further away than smaller wavelengths (purple)</a>. Or only one color of light is used to see how light from the source constructively and destructively interferes with each other. And the resulting image can be used to study how waves work. <br> <br>
      However, instead of using one source of light through a slit, say one photon is fired at a time through either slit. Normally this would mean zero light patterns as there cannot be any interference between photons. Despite this, an interference pattern occurs anyway. Why is this the case?
    </p>


    <h2>Correlation/Causation</h2>
    <h5>Date: 10/19/2018</h5>
    <p>
    About the pause between 10/2 to 10/19, this time period was kind of a terrible time period for me. Everyone really goes through one of those, though, and now I finally have time to do more brain dumps. <br> <br>
    Anyways, there are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics. The former two are self explanatory, but the third one is the interesting one. <br>
    What does it mean by statistics being a 'lie'? <br> <br>
    If you go to this <a href="http://tylervigen.com/old-version.html">site</a>, you will see a bunch of graphs that tend to follow very similar patterns. And according to statistics, that is showing correlation, as in, two sets of data are very closely similar or has a casual relationship; in other words the sets of data follow a similar pattern. <br> <br>
    Many statistics makes it seem like correlation means one causes the other. And that's an implied bias - if two sets of data follow a similar pattern, one ought to cause another, right? In other words, causation. <br> <br>
    Observe the first graph in the site above. It shows a set of data that represents US spending on science, space, and technology, and a set of data that represents suicides by hanging/strangulation/suffocation, and the data sets are very correlated; both go up at a similar rate. <br> <br>
    But how does US spending on science/space/tech increase suicides by hanging/strangulation/suffocation? It just can't be explained (maybe if the increase was small we could attribute it to alien technology). <br> <br>
    The reason for this is simply because an increase in population increases suicide count and also increases the GDP of the US - in other words, correlation doesn't imply causation.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <h2> Experimentation </h2>
    <h5>Date: 10/02/2018</h5>
    <p>
      There have been a lot of people thinking about all kinds of crazy theories to phenomena in the world out there, like 'Is our world flat'. Some theories have people really believing it to be true. But why are these theories actually theories? And how do we consciously reject certain theories? <br> <br>
      Some people may believe our world is flat. But just look at photos of the Earth from the ISS. Or, if the world was indeed flat, where does the sun come from? Does it erupt out of the flat earth, or is there some 'boundary' that should a person walk over, they fall down into an abyss? <br> <br>
      Gravity too in a sense helps explain why the world can't be flat. All other celestial bodies are round because a central gravitating point pulls matters equally in all directions, generating that round shape. <br> <br>
      This entire process of trying out theories (or the disproving of such), testing them against the world, obtaining results and observations is the process of experimentation. That experiment in school where you drop a ball and measure the gravitational constant of Earth? You are using measurement tools to measure and test, multiple times, the world and its constraints to find out how gravity works. <br> <br>
      I decided to change the format of this blog, too, because I wanted to experiment if changing the style would make a difference to how I view this tiny project of mine. That in itself is a testing on the world, namely myself. I think it won't, but oh well.

    <h2>Technological Singularity</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/30/2018</h5>
    <p>
      1943, the first computer spanning multiple rooms were created. <br>
      Back then, no one really knew what this would lead to. <br> <br>

      Now, the one you are using to read this is probably a million times faster than you at calculations. <br>
      And this speed of technological growth will only accelerate. <br> <br>

      At one point, humanity will most likely create a technological singularity. This is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial intelligence will cause the AI to grow in an extremely fast rate, surpassing the rate of humans' technological growth. This will eventually cause the AI to dominate all technological fields and become a technological singularity, while all of humans' roles are wiped out as technology does everything better than humans. <br> <br>

      As much as this is concerning, however, and there are pacts between countries to never develop AI, there is just too much incentive to create one, and it seems likely that one day, there will be one and we will become quite literally useless. Is it a good thing? Perhaps we were destined to create a technological overlord. Or perhaps all of our technological research is going to lead nowhere and AI will never be created. <br> <br>
      Hopefully, however, we will never see the day of AI running rampant in our society.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Coming Up With Ideas</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/25/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Normally there comes a point when you do anything where you just don't know what to do next. Like when you're done with a really good book and can't find something similar. Or when you don't know how to solve a big looming problem that impedes your progress. <br> <br>

      A nice thing to do is to relax first, soften your brain up, and then come up with ideas, unless the problem is urgent. But if the problem is urgent, then maybe it's time management problems. <br> <br>
      There are a few easy ways to first relax. Relaxing your brain first eases your tension and allows you later on to better focus on the task at hand, helping your procedure in searching for that next book or looking for that key to the problem. Some things you can do include sleeping (a nice 8 hour sleep can seriously restart your mind and is helpful), meditating (just a nice 10 minutes to just put yourself back into where you are), or just doing what you like doing in your free time, be it walking outside, playing with toys, .etc. <br> <br>

      Once your brain is relieved of tension, it can better come up with ideas! But ideas don't just randomly walk into your brain and say 'hi'.  <br>
      Some things you can do include coming up with what would be the worst ideas to the problem at hand. Generally, there is value to terrible ideas - not only do they give you a general pattern of what not to think about, better focusing on what makes a good solution, but there may be hidden gems you previously discarded. <br>
      Another thing you can do is to think beyond the scope of what you like. If you need a new book, maybe you could pick up a movie instead. Maybe you don't really need to deal with the problem by not walking down this path at all. And so on. <br> <br>

      There are generally a lot of great ways to deal with the problem of 'what to do', but one of them is to not make 'what to do' as a solution, like I did with this blog post.

    <h2>Dark Energy, Big Rip (UD Part 3)</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/23/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Part 3 of Universe Death Series as illustrated here. <br> <br>

      The Big Crunch theory suggests that over time, things will slow down and stop moving, and then slowly move towards each other and form a singularity. <br> <br>

      Well, unfortunately, things are actually moving away at an accelerating rate. The nearest galaxies are actually slowly moving further away from us, and the 'slowing down' seems to be non-existent. <br> <br>

      Perhaps the galaxies gained too much energy from the Big Bang, and over time it'll follow the Big Crunch theory. Or... <br> <br>

      Scientists have coined a term 'Dark Energy' for a mysterious energy of the universe that propels things away from each other. It is called 'Dark Energy' because we don't know if it exists, as it's not observable. <br>

      We don't know if this Dark Energy is strong enough to slowly rip the fabric of spacetime apart, as we don't know what it is. But if the dark energy were hypothetically strong enough, it would first pull all galaxies far away from each other, and slowly, star systems will be pulled away from each other, then planets will be pulled away from their stars as the Dark Energy rips everything away from each other. <br> <br>
      Eventually, all quarks and leptons will be ripped from each other, and there will be nothing left in the universe. This is the Big Rip.

    </p>

    <h2>Gravitation, Big Crunch (UD Part 2)</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/22/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Part 2 of Universe Death Series as illustrated here. <br> <br>

      Gravity pulls all things with mass together. You are attracting the sun right now, and so is a tiny electron, and the earth is pulling you towards it, allowing us to stay on the surface and never leave. <br> <br> <br>
      When the Big Bang occurred, everything ejected in all directions at massive velocities. <br> <br>
      But even as they were moving away from each other, they only had one acceleration: gravity. And theoretically, if the stellar objects are not moving at a fast enough speed, eventually gravity will stop it to a halt. And then the objects will start moving towards each other. <br> <br>

      Eventually all the matter will gravitate towards the center of the universe, and generate another singularity. This is the Big Crunch. <br> <br>

      This is also the only theoretical universe ending that supports multiple universes in the same timeline! As a big bang of the singularity created our universe as is currently, and this ending creates another singularity, it is plausible that it will explode again, creating a whole new universe! <br> <br>

      Or it can just stay there and be a good singularity. It can do whatever it wants, right?

      According to the second law of thermodynamics, nothing is ever 100% efficient. Not all electricity that goes into the screen you are reading this from is used to display this webpage; some of it is lost as friction via rubbing against the wire while travelling to your screen, some of it is lost as heat radiated from your screen, etc. <br> <br>

      This increases a value called 'entropy', or a state of disorder. This can be thought of as 'heat' for the purposes of this explanation. <br>
      Because nothing can be over 100% efficient, as a result, entropy or heat can never decrease. Even a machine made to absorb heat would actually ironically generate more heat! Like ACs, for instance. <br> <br>
      This means that over time, the overall temperature of the universe will slowly increase as entropy starts piling up. And as no space in the universe is isolated from all other spaces (disregarding black holes as even they will decay over time...), the universe will turn into a massive hot energy ball over time, causing a 'heat death' with no more physical phenomena.

    <h2>Escapism/Addiction</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/17/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Everyone tends to have something they like doing. Be it a game, music, art, solving problems, and so on. But every now and then, we lose interest in things, we want to escape into more interesting hobbies instead. The notion of running away from the dull lives we have into a supposedly fascinating medium is escapism. <br> <br>
      Like, watching television shows all day long, even when you need to do boring tasks at life. <br> <br>
      A common cause of slipping your hobbies and doing less interesting but more enjoyable tasks include the fact that some daily tasks tend to give slow results or rewards and lack of determination. <br> <br>
      Addiction is formed when one's brain's dopamine outburst becomes a crave, especially when normalized into nothingness. When we constantly get dopamine outburst from television, for instance, we tend to crave that outburst when we're not watching television. When your daily lives are boring, and a medium promises to give you a lot of dopamine, you're more bound to start getting that dopamine overload in your brain and become addicted, causing escapism. <br> <br>
      People can often feel discouraged when doing their hobbies. This can include whenever they constantly make mistakes. When one is frustrated often when they make mistakes, they would want to start wanting perfect alternatives. Television and other media will never go wrong - they are perfect, which captures these kinds of people perfectly. Of course, there will be people who like the mistakes and challenge, but a lot of people get put down easily from mistakes. <br> <br>

    <h2>The Free Will Debate</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/15/2018</h5>
    <p>
      There's always been a recurring question throughout life: 'Are our decisions in our control?' <br><br>
      What if our decisions to do anything are impeded? As in, is it already predetermined you will wake up at 9 AM today, or did we truly decide for ourselves that we will wake up now? <br>
      Normally, we would presume that we do indeed have free will. After all, everything we've done, we've consciously thought about it, right? But that may just be an illusion. We may just be 'tricked' into thinking we are deciding something, when the universe already decided what you will decide on. <br> <br> <Br>

      These are the two sides of the free will debate. And scientifically, both sides do exist. <br> <br>
      Those who believe in determinism argue that if you have enough information about a situation, you can predict any future event with perfect precision. Which tends to be pretty true; a lot of information can allow one to analyze situations, people's tendencies, to calculate methodically what will probably happen. <br>
      This, however, isn't always exactly true. Human emotions tend to be really spontaneous, irrational, and may cause people to do things that break the rational information predictions. <br> <br>
      On the other hand, the free will argument can be made by simply looking at quantum mechanics. At the subatomic level, particles are truly random on where they can be, and with it, pulses that confer what to do will also be random and not pre-calculate-able, making your decisions truly your own.
      But does small shifts in particle movements have a huge impact on decisions? <br> <br>
      At the end of the day, both sides are valid, as there is no defined answer - only you and all other individuals individually can decide that for yourselves.

    <h2>65,537 and the Interesting Number Paradox</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/11/2018</h5>
    <p>
      65,537 is a pretty interesting number. It is currently the largest Fermat prime number known, which is a prime number that also happens to be a Fermat number which is a number expressed in the form 2^(2^n) + 1. If n is 4, then 2^4 is 16, and 2^16 is 65536, and plus one is 65,537. No other fermat numbers are currently known to be prime, which makes this number interesting. <br> <br>
      The largest n-gon constructible by a compass and ruler where n is odd also turns out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65537-gon#Construction">65537</a>. <br> <br>
      But the concept of 'interesting' depends wildly on perspective. Some may say 65,537 is not a very interesting number and there are more interesting ones (Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)">1729</a>). So there may exist varying degrees of 'interesting'. <br> <br>
      But, by definition ALL numbers must be interesting. <br>
      If 2 were the smallest unintersting number, that itself would make it interesting. Similarly, if there existed a set of uninteresting numbers, the first number of that list would become interesting by virtue of being the first uninteresting number. In other words, a set of uninteresting numbers cannot exist. <br> <br>
      In other words we should appreciate mathematics and every number that comes out of it because by sheer definition all numbers are interesting by default. This is the Interesting Number Paradox.

    <h2>Solar Flares</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/09/2018</h5>
    <p>
      This meta nonsense aside, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ASolar_Blast.ogv">a solar flare</a> is actually a really cool phenomena. It involves a sudden flash of brightness, often near the surface. It is typically caused by the magnetic energy built up by the atmopshere's  interactions with charged particles like electrons. It tends to be like an ejection of energy, generating a lot of light in the process. <br> <br>
      The total amount of energy and light generated comes out to be somewhere between 1E20 and 1E25 Joules. This is still a really massive amount of energy; the amount of energy required to keep a 60 watt lightbulb running for an hour for instance is only 216,000 J. This is also why it's called a solar flare; the sheer amount of light generated act much like a flare that happens very briefly before fizzling. <br> <br>
      The reason why I named this site after this phenomena is because if every single thing in a human body were transformed into energy and released, 7.2E19 Joules would be released, almost the energy of a single solar flare. I tend to be more of a optimistic nihilist, and the idea that I have ~80 years to shine radiantly however so I choose, in a quick flash, is how I portray my life. Much like a solar flare. But it also works for my pessimistic nihilist view. The fact that this energy will fizzle out after that flash, and nothing is left behind that shows the flare did happen, at least visually, is indictive of the inevitable doom. <br> <br> <br>

      But at the end of the day, I just really like flashy things.

    <h2>False Beliefs</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/07/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Do People use only 10 percent of their brains? Do you eat on average 8 spiders in your sleep in a year? Does swallowed gum stay in you for 7 years? <br> <br>

      If you thought the answer to any of them were yes, then you were probably influenced by people and the internet around you, as they are all false. <br>
      There are a couple of problems that make people believe things that are factually incorrect. This includes the availability heuristic and emotions. <br>
      Do people get killed by terrorists or cars more often?  The availability heuristic is a shortcut to questions like the one above that relies on immediate examples that come to mind. While the former is more vivid and more likely to be stored in your mind than car accidents, alongside news reporting terrorists far more often, in reality people die by cars far more often than terrorists. It as a result can make one believe in false beliefs like people dying by terrorists more than cars - simply because it is more readily available in the mind than car accidents. <br> <br>

      Our emotions are a powerful factor in believing false things. The 8 spiders in sleep per year plays on the idea of fear, and if one is already controlled in the emotional side of things, it is more likely for the individual to accept that it is true and take precautions to stop it, as logical reasoning is diminished when one's emotions have taken over. <br > <br>

      But it is true that these tools that make us believe in false beliefs are also those that have been necessary to our survival, so it's like a double-edged sword in many ways.

    <h2>Automatic vs Controlled Processes</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/05/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Try to type this message on this textbox: "Hello World". <br> <br>
      <input type="text"> <br> <br>
      Now, switch your hands positions (so right hand is on f and left hand is on j) and type it again here: <br> <br>
      <input type="text"> <br> <br>
      If you actually did it there would have been a very noticeable difference in the time elapsed to type that message. The first would have been a breeze; but the second task would have taken a very long time. <br>
      What is happening here is that we have been very used to typing with our left hand on the ASDF area while the right hand is on the JKL; area. By doing it repeatedly our brain has developed the neural pathways in our brain to instantly associate a letter to a position to one of our hands, and send a signal to our left or right hand to move and press that letter. <br> <br>
      In fact, it's so automatic that you probably can type entire words in less than a second; we just have been so used to typing like this that our brains have made the process instantaneously quickly. <br>Imagine in your first days of typing how quickly you typed. You likely would have been the pace of the second task. This is because we are trying to find the positions of the letters themselves first, then after spotting it, telling our brain where it is, and then the brain returns a signal to a hand telling it to press it. <br> <br>
       By continuously typing, we have turned this self-conscious controlled process of individually identifying the position of a letter then sending a signal to type it, to an automatic process of instantly associating a letter to a position and effortlessly sending a signal to press it as soon as you think of it.

    <h2>Blue Part 2</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/03/2018</h5>
    <p>
      The atmosphere has air particles. While most of the red, orange, yellow and the other longer wavelengths mostly pass through the air with no change, the wavelengths of the blue spectrum are often absorbed by the air particles, and then released into the air as radiation. The sky appears blue because this exact radiated blue light is what reaches your eyes. But nearer the horizon there is more distance meaning more blue radiation is released in a different direction. This is because the air particles in the way will absorb it and release it in a different direction! <br> <br>

      This explains some other phenomena. Why is the sky red in a sunset? This is because the light now directly goes towards your eyes from the sun, and less of the blue wavelengths, making the sky a reddish one. <br> <br>

      Why is the space black? There is no air to 'reflect' the wavelengths of the light source back into your eyes, so there is no light. Black is the abscence of light, so that is why space is black.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Blue Part 1</h2>
    <h5>Date: 09/01/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Our eyes work by receiving light waves from outer sources. It then converts the light waves into signals that our brain then processes as signals. <br>

      Light waves are given off from literally everything around you. Those same things also give off radiation of other kinds like gamma radiation, but our eyes do not detect it. As a result, the light that our eyes can pick up are called light waves or visible waves while those that can't are in other categories like microwaves or gamma waves.<br> <br>

      Why do some things emit red waves while some things emit blue waves, then? Things aren't constantly changing color but are stable. A tomato is red because it absorbs all other wavelengths of visible light but reflect red waves into your eye. But where is the red wave coming from? <br> <br>

      There is usually a light source that shows you that the color is red. In a dark room, you would not be able to tell what color a tomato is. But because the light source emits white light to the tomato, and the tomato absorbs all but red light, that is the color you see a tomato as. <br> <br>

      ...But then why is the sky blue? Light waves actually just straightly pass through and are relatively unaffected, so shouldn't it have no color?</a>

    <h2>Probabilities Part 2 - Cards</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/30/2018</h5>
    <p>
      A deck of cards have 52 cards. If you were to shuffle them and place them on a pile, they are probably a deck of cards in a order that is never before seen in the entire universe. <br>
      Of course, this sounds insane. There are only 52 cards in a deck and there are multiple millions of people that play cards and have shuffled the deck many times in their life. So how can this be? <br> <br>
      What do you think the total number of ways to order a deck of 52 cards are? 1 million? 10 million? Maybe a billion or even a trillion? <br>
      Mathematically, the total number of ways to order a deck of cards is 52 factorial. This is 8.06 times 10 to the 67... Or 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000. <br> <br>
      In comparison, ever since the big bang, the universe had a total of a mere 4.35 times 10 to the 17 seconds! A deck being a new composition of 52 cards thus is (total number of existing compositions) / 8.06 * 10^67, which is still probably well over 99%. <br> <br>

      Even if there are an astronomically large number of something (in this case all known shuffles of the deck in the entire universe), if there is an even astronomically larger number (all possible shuffles), it doesn't matter if the number is still incomprehensibly large, it is completely dwarfed by an even large number and is reduced to insignificance. <br> <br>


    </p>
    <h2>Precision and Accuracy</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/29/2018</h5>
    <p>
      What is precision and accuracy in a scientific context? <br>
      For instance, lets say that a research study, labelled A, finds that there is 60.5% silicon in gummy bears. Another research study, labelled B, finds that there is 39.99999999% silicon in gummy bears. <br> <br>

      Precision is a measure of how many significant digits there are in a number. Simply put, each non-zero digit is a significant digit and all zeros at the end of a number to the right of the decimal point. 39.99999999% would be more precise than 60.5% due to its large array of significant digits. <br> <br>

      As we all know the true value of silicon in gummy bears is 100%, we can evaluate the accuracy of the two research studies. That is, how close the result values are to the real value. In this scenario, A is more accurate than B because 60.5 is closer to 100 than 39.99999999. <br> <br>

      And lastly, sorry for all gummy bear enthusiasts and haters, but the two research studies are completely, totally false.

    <h2>Procrastination - Social Media</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/28/2018</h5>
    <p>
      People, naturally, don't want to do things they dislike doing. After all, you get dopamine from doing addictive things like watching tv or playing games, which make you happier than doing that lousy history homework. <br> <br>
      Procrastination is what happens when you put aside things you have to do in favor of things you like to do, but are not what you have to do at the present moment. <br>
      According to a study, about 66% of all procrastination cases have people go to social media. Talking to other people, seeing what other people are doing. But when you are not on social media, you want to constantly check it. <br>
      This is defined as the fear of missing out, or FOMO, where at any point if you do not go on social media you feel left out of the social media community and thus there is the constant urge to check for any new updates or chat with basically anyone. <br>
      Experiments have shown that people get anxious whenever they hear social media sounds, and even more so if they cannot immediately check on it - proving the urge to check social media exists and consequently the urge to procrastinate via going on social media.<br> <br>
      And as an individual who constantly deals with procrastination, it is very hard to get started on working - after all, reading social media websites are far more enjoyable and fun. <br> <br>
      It at the end of the day boils down to whether or not you can suppress your desires. And of course, such is very difficult. As the human neural path takes about 90 days to reset, it will require 90 days of no impulse from that source to be free from the procrastination - and no one wants that. For instance, the biggest offender, social media, no one will be willing to quit social media basically forever - it is crucial to the identity for a lot of people, and there is the fear of missing out that drives people to always return. <br>
      So this isn't just a problem of quitting the source of procrastination - it is more of a psychological one. <br> <br>

    <h2>Memories</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/27/2018</h5>
    <p>
      It's true that everyone has only one life. And at the end of it, you die. That's how pretty much everyone lives will go except a couple of cryogenically frozen people. <br> <br>
      And biologically, most people don't differ a lot except for a couple silent mutations here and there. <br>
      There are ultimately two fundamental differences between people and other people: physical attributes, and memories. <br> <br>
      In this post I want to talk about the latter. Your own set of experiences, and memories derived from such, are completely unique. Not to mention the memories that you have imprinted on other people. This makes you significant from a mathematical perspective: no person will ever have the same set of experiences as you do, and the idea of uniqueness makes you significant.<br> <br>
      But besides the mathematical perspective, memories themselves define who you are, alongside your genetics. The memories serve as your environment, and has an impact on your psychology and overall how you act to things. If you have a memory of getting injured on sandpaper, you won't attempt to do whatever you were doing with the sandpaper again.<br>
      But it is true that if you're sad you tend to think of sad memories while if you're happy you tend to think of happy memories (the state-dependent memory). This means that what you're thinking of is literally a glimpse into your current mood state! <br>
      And so these precious mind bubbles aren't just things that embarass you from time to time, but they're also a part of you, and guide you through similar scenarios!

    <h2>Probabilities Part 1 - Coin</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/26/2018</h5>
    <p>
      We normally attribute flipping a coin as having a 50/50 chance, so such is often used to decide one thing out of a pair. <br>
      There is one problem: it's not. <br> <br>
      What if it lands on its side? Such an event albeit being very rare is still certainly possible. If that happens, do you just not choose both since one side correlates to an option? Or do you just flip again? <br>
      It probably happens too rarely for you to even consider that case though, if you were to decide a case by coin flip. No one would stop and think about what to do if it lands on its side, they just flip the coin having defined heads = A and tails = B, without considering what to do if side comes up.<br> <br>
      Also, even if you removed the side case, it's still not an even 50/50. Studies have shown that the initial face up side when flipped has a 51% chance of landing at the end compared to the measely 49% the initial face down side has. <br>
      Even worse, the coin is deterministic. If you could correctly calibrate the amount of force the coin receives, the amount of drag in the air, collision elasticity, and other factors, it will always land on the same side. <br> <br>
      Which brings the question, is life deterministic or free will? Determinism is the idea that everything in life is already planned out, as in, whenever you flip a coin, its variables are all generated by some omnipresent force to give exactly this response. Free will, on the other hand, argues that everything is truly random. The coin flip will truly give a 51/49 response every time and it is not decided by some magical force. <br>
      People have debated on this issue for a long time, but the horrifying or fun truth is, we will never know. <br> <br>
      But the true question is, how did all of this come from the act of flipping a coin? Human imagination is certainly weird. And creative.

    <h2>3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/25/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Practically speaking, beyond 3.1415926535 can be discarded in our day-to-day lives as it is inconsequential, it will almost never be needed. But even if its really useless in daily lives, why do people still bother to research deep into irrational numbers like pi or e? <br>
      <br>
      There definitely is a use to a precise pi, for instance astrophysicists. Even if unrelated to pi, a miscalculation or imprecision can cause complete failure of landings for instance. So having that very precise measure can definitely be helpful to STEM fields... to a degree. <br>
      The thing is, the record for most decimal places of pi calculated have been steadily increasing, as recently as 2016 November, when 22 trillion digits of pi were calculated. <br>
      For context, having a document with 22 trillion 'b's has a size of 22,000 gigabytes. That's 200 laptop's worth of storage space, which is downright bonkers.
      <br> <br>
      Will anyone who need precise calculations ever need all that 22 trillion digits of precision? I don't even think they would use 1000 digits, let alone 22 trillion. So after the 10,000 mark, what even is the point of calculating beyond that?
      <br> <br>
      Math isn't just about solving problems, in fact in my perspective it's the exact opposite. Math is about being curious about patterns in the real world, and irrational numbers are a pattern of its own. People are not calculating 22 trillion digits of pi to solve any kind of problem, but the problem of 'what does 22 trillion digits of pi look like?' The digits ultimately are just a satiation to the curiosity of people, and people will solve these kinds of problems because they can - and it's fun to them.

    <h2>Importance and Nihilism</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/24/2018</h5>
    <p>
      There are three ways this universe can end according to the collective knowledge we have so far: <br>
      Heat Death,<br>
      Big Crunch, <br>
      And the Big Rip. <br>
      <br>
      But what they are is a subject for another blog post. One of these inevitably will occur in the distant future, at least according to our knowledge so far. <br>
      What does this mean? The world and anything you have done will one day have all traces of it erased. Nothing will remain in the end. <br>
      <br>
      So why bother doing them? Is what a pessimist nihilist says. And only does things that he wants to do to maximize his enjoyment as nothing truly has meaning in the end so might as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      But it also means that nothing will matter! What anyone thinks you're doing has any matter in what you're doing. So this thought could mean you becomes far more energetic and do things people will consider weird just because you want to do it. It also means that life would be an adventure will many unknowns. This is an optimist nihilist. <br>
      <br>
      As a nihilist who thinks both ways on and off, I do think it's sometimes stigmatized as a bunch of no-energy people who don't do things and don't believe in anything, but that's not really true, it just means that we perceive the endings of this timeline differently and not much can differ, surprisingly. <br> <br>
      There's no correct philosophy to live in and most people aren't a nihilist in the first place. After all, it's your life. But the point of this blog post is to show two perspectives of emphasizing importance, and there would be many others. <br>
      <br>
      But there is no correct philosophy to live in, as stated earlier, so that's an adventure of its own kind, to figure out others' perspectives! How do you perceive importance in things? <br>

    <br>
    <h2>Dimensions</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/23/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Our world is a three-dimensional world operating through time which most scientists consider as the fourth. <br>
      That is, spacetime. <br>
      <br>
      Time is a really interesting concept, as you could really think of time as a dimension in itself. Imagine a line of boxes, with each box representing a unit of time (planck time) Then we would be travelling through the fourth dimension simply by existing: you reading this sentence would have hurled you more than a million of these frames! <br>
      <br>
      This has interesting applications for the fifth dimension. The multiverse theory in essence would be a fifth dimension as all possibilities are a 'fourth dimension' and compiling it onto a plane would be the multiverse. <br>
      <br>
      But that's not the only possible definition of dimensions. As the first four dimensions (0, 1, 2, 3) are all geometric, can't it be the case that the 4th dimension is also geometric in nature as well? This would be impossible to visualize to us, but that is because our vision is 3 dimensional, and our concept of space and geometry come from our eyesights. <br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the biggest reason though why most consider time as the 4th dimension is it is easily perceivable; we can't exactly even hypothesize how 4th dimension will work. <br>
      On the other hand, mathematically 4th dimension being geometric makes the most sense, as we denote direction in geometry via (x, y, z) so it makes sense for the fourth dimension to be in the form (x, y, z, a). <br>
      <br>
      At the end of the day, there are many dimensions to the argument 'what is the fourth dimension?'.

    <h2>Starting Things</h2>
    <h5>Date: 08/22/2018</h5>
    <p>
      Normally the hardest thing in any adventure is the beginning. Take this blog for example. I've always wanted to start a site of my own just for the sake of fun and learning since 2016. <br>
      <br>
      Well, it's 2018. <br>
      <br>
      Of course, just because it's delayed doesn't necessarily mean that the idea will die off, nor does it mean that it will be delayed forever. Maybe something in life came up, and you have to attend to it first. Maybe you'd rather do other things first, then come back to it later. As long as you end up doing it in the end, it shouldn't matter whatsoever, like 60 year olds entering first grade.<br>
      <br>
      As I start a random journey to document my CS life, this is what I have learned. There is nothing to be ashamed of for starting things late, nor is there anything that will punish you (as long as they aren't some project due at some day of course). The first step is always the hardest, as they say. <br>
      <br>
      In fact, once I got the framework rolling, I found it easier to actually continue writing, so if you're on the fence too about starting something, you should. And see how it goes! Life is ultimately an adventure that you alongside 7 other billion players play, real-time, so just don't hesitate, really.<br>
      <br>
      I mean, if you don't like it you can always quit it in favor of something else, right? Hopefully that doesn't happen.
