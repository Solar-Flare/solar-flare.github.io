			<h6>Literal Flying Pawns</h6>
			<p>
				My first ever pygame project! <br><br>
				There are these things called <a href=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/>boids</a>. Basically, they move in a direction that abides by three rules: <br>
				1. Separation: The boid steers away from nearby boids; it tries not to make a 'crowded' environment. In the image above, no two boids are on each other.<br>
				2. Alignment: The boid steers towards the average direction that nearby boids are going. In the image above, all boids are going in the same direction. <br>
				3. Cohesion: The boid steers towards the average position of nearby boids, to create like a lattice. <br> <br><br>
				I also made it so that a new pawnboid is created when clicking on the screen. <br>
				Multiple errors rose throughout this challenge. This included: <br>
				1. Image rendering: Over time, the pawn images will literally defragment and explode. Turns out pygame is bad at turning images as for a 20x20 image it generates a larger and then burns it down to a 20x20. What happens over time is the loss of pixels and defragmentation. This was solved by constantly recreating the image and turning it once before the next recreation. <br>
				2. The initial initialization of the vector, position and acceleration positions were accidentally calculated in integers. This produced rather funny glitches like sudden warpings of the boids or static movement. <br>
				3. The boids will be all clumped together like moths to a lightbulb. Turns out the cohesion was too strong and changing that fixed that problem. <br>

				Overall, I got to reuse classes in python, utilize pygame and image rendering, which was pretty fun.
