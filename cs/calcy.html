			<h6>The result of 9989 times 65</h6>
			<p>
				This was my final project of AP CS A, and the only surviving artifact from that class due to my computer changes. <br>
				Generally, what happens here is that the computer stores the first number you put in before clicking on an operator (in this case 9989), stores the operator, then stores the second number. <br>
				<br>
				If there are more than two operators, it first calculates the first operation then stores that in the first number slot, ready to take in another number to operate on another operator. <br> <br>
				CE removes the second number slot, while AC removes all number slots including the operator. <br> <br>
				It was a surprisingly challenging final project and I ended up pulling an all-nighter to finish it but I feel like I've gained more insight into how initialization of variables and also appreciation to the hard machines who calculate math for us without us even realizing how it works. <br> <br>
				<br>
				And of course, the popcorn button does nothing.
