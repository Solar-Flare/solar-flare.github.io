			<h6>Not an Edible Crescent Moon</h6>
			<p>
				This is a modification to the first perceptron in which the data set, instead of being user-input, is replaced by a 2000-point set, where 1000 points are red and 1000 points are blue and are both shaped like a half moon. It is very slightly linearly separateable, but barely. <br>
				This serves as a way of making sure the perceptron is at least really capable of linear classification.
