			<h2>Image Classifier</h2>

			<p>
				There exists very few scripts that come built in with an image classifier. <a href=https://ml5js.org/docs/getting-started.html>ml5js</a> is one of them, and I decided to create a html program that takes an input image, sends it to ml5js, and display the returned values. <br> <br>

				A couple of problems were incurred throughout the process, namely one that caused the image to not be sent to the server. It turns out the id values were incorrect; only after multiple trials did I realize the problem wasn't with the ml5js framework but rather the process of delivering the image to analyze. <br> <br>
				getElementById looks for id of an html element, not the class name. This was causing the communications error. <br>
				Besides that, however, no major error was incurred.
