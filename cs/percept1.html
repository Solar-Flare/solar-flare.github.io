			<h6>Classification of a linear line between two sets of data</h6>
			<p>
				The goal of this program is to linearly classify two sets of data, as shown above. <br><br>
				<a href="https://i2.wp.com/abhay.harpale.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/perceptron-picture.png">The Perceptron </a> is a learning algorithm that utilizes two defined weights and a bias. What the program does is it first randomizes the weights, and then checks the set of data to see if it matches. <br>
				If everything matches, it stops! As the data is linearly classified correctly (even if not correct in terms of linear regression). <br>
				If there exists a point that is in the incorrect boundary, the scanning stops. And then, the coordinates are fed into an algorithm that modifies the weights (and the bias accordingly). This can be summarized as: <br> <br>
				New_weight = Old_weight + learn_rate(target - output) * coordinate <br>
				New_bias = learn_rate(target - output) <br>
				Target is what we want the data point to be. In this case red wants to be above, so its target is 1e Output is 0 if the line were to be above the point. For blue it is vice versa. <br>
				The learn_rate is an arbitrary number used to dictate how quickly the perceptron 'learns'. <br> <br>
				Some challenges that came about while making this includes: <br>
				1. The window was scaled to (-300, 300) instead of (0, 1): This made the algorithm extremely wacky if not out of control. <br>
				2. The line would spiral out of control multiple times. Turns out once the line turns negative, the 'above' for the line actually becomes below the line! This was fixed by absolute valuing the scanning function. <br>
				Overall, pretty fun.
