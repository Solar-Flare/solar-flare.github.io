			<h2>Blog Technical Update</h2>
			<h5>Date: 06/10/2018</h5>
			<p>
				First off, yes, this blog is still alive. <br>
				I just had AP and IB exams like any other good senior. While I'd argue that there should be more options than just these two that are universal, that's an argument for another day. <br> <br>

				I decided to completely revamp this blog's program structure. Whenever I wanted to make a change in the categories (i.e. adding another section to the sidebar), it was basically impossible since I had to go through every single page, and insert another line of code into the html. <br> <br>

				So, I used a javascript program to store this entire background scripts into a single file to delete all duplicate occurences into a single program, reducing the total size and hopefully making future changes to the sidebar much, much easier. <br> <br>
				If you actually read this blog (I'm pretty sure there's like no one haha) then you'll now notice that switching tabs first show you a really white screen for a split second then load everything. This is a side effect of what sidebar.js does. <br> <br>
