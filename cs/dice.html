			<h6>Minimalistic Terminal Game</h6>
			<p>
				This simple incremental dice rolling game with an ending is probably my first real C# project. <br> <br>
				Random number generation was probabaly my hardest problem in this process. In C#, Random.Next does not generate a new random number, if done in quick succession, as the generation is based on the system-supplied seed value that is the same value in very similar time intervals. So I would have cases where rolling 5 cubes end up being 30 (6, 6, 6, 6, 6), and I didn't know how to solve it until looking into the documentation. <br> <br>
				Overall, though, it still was a relatively fun project that showed me how C# syntax works.
