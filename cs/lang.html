			<h6>Random english passage from <a href="https://randomtextgenerator.com/">randomtextgenerator.com</a></h6>
			<p>
				This mini challenge utilizes the percentage of letters in each language. There is a list of percentages of each letter in 7 different languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Portugese, Esperanto, and Italian), and then the input string is broken down into letters and their percentages. <br><br>
				This one wasn't that challenging as after the data was set up correctly, the percentage breakdown was implemented, there wasn't a big problem. The nature of this program itself doesn't allow for much errors either, though I got to learn how tkinter for python works, which is the big takeaway from this. <br>
