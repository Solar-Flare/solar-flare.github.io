			<h6>Red and Blue dots, with a regression line that wobbles around the line drawn above</h6>
			<p>
				This is a modification to the first perceptron in which the screen has been modified to the correct ratio (0,0) to (1,1), and several bug fixes are incurred. <br> <br>
				The effect of this fix is that should there be no clear line that separates the two sets of data, the line would converge to a 'line' that best separates the data, as shown above.
