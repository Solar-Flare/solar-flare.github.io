			<h6>Squirmy little live things</h6>
			<p>
				Conway's Game of Life is a simulation meant to simulate life in a Turing machine. If a point has too many neighbors it dies but also if it has too little neighbors it dies as well. <br>
				It combines the idea that some areas will be stable while others will be chaotic and that they will intertwine to a degree. <br>
				From doing this, I have learned more about iterations, object-oriented programming as each point has its own class in the code written, and surprisingly a sense of appreciation for cs as an art as the patterns this zero-sum game can create can sometimes be mesmerizing. <br>
