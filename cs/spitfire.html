			<h6>Cheesy 8-Bit Graphics</h6>
			<p>
				This is a game written in python where you control a plane, it shoots stuff, there are enemies, they shoot stuff, if you get hit too much you die, and things like that. <br> <br>
				Sprites in pygame are a really weird fickle thing. Making sure they collide requires a special function, and pasting the images there was a really weird kind of challenge. I didn't encounter any serious problem while writing this one but the countless research that went into the pygame algorithm and turning classes into sprites was the big difficulty while making this. <br> <br>

				I don't think I'll leave it like this, however. I might dust it off and add more stuff down the road which might be fun.
