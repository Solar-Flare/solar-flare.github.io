			<h6>The AI is literally undefeatable. Well, it also can't win either...</h6>
			<p>
				Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player game featuring a 3 by 3 grid, and one player draw a circle, then the next player draws a cross, then the first player draws another circle, and so on. The goal is to make a straight line, which makes you the winner; if neither player succeeds when the grid is full, no one wins. With perfect play, the game will always draw. <br> <br>
				Some problems that arose included: <br>
				The computer missing a very key move where (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (0,2) leads to an immediate win for player 1 with (2,0), and it wouldn't pick up to the point where I had to manually code in this special case (and the AI playing (2,0) instead of (0,2) is dealt with as well). <br>
				That was probably the only real problem in this program challenge.
