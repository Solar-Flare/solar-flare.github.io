				<h2>Normality</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/20/2018</h5>
				<p>
					There are probably a lot of people out there you would consider 'weird'. Like, their actions seem off, their entire body screams 'I'm weird', and things like that. <br> <br>
					Even if there wasn't a person you consider that way, what exactly is 'weird'? Google defines 'weird' as 'bizarre, strange' but those words in term mean 'hard to understand or unsettling'. <br>
					This implies that if everyone in the universe except you turned into those people that you consider weird, people will find you hard to understand and find you weird, and their definition of normal becomes the norm! <br> <br>
					So what exactly is 'weird' and 'normal'? At the end of the day, those terms are societally defined as that's what precisely defines 'hard to understand'. What everyone thinks as okay are the ones that are normal and actions that people normally not do are naturally, as a result, the 'weird' ones. <br> <br>

					But nothing is ever binary. Nothing is ever black or white. <br> <br>

					Some things are not weird enough to be considered at the weird category but at the same time is not exactly easy to understand, either. Take scratching your neck. It's not considered normal, but I doubt a lot of people will find that to be 'weird'. <br> <br>

					Which brings up a third perspective to this thought process... Other people's definitions of 'normal' and 'weird' are naturally not the same as yours. I may believe that neck scratching is not weird enough and is not normal enough, but some people might find it to be excessively weird. Which one is the societal definition tends to be what the majority thinks. <br> <br>

					But at the end of the day, does it really matter all that much, though?

				<h2>Binomial Tests</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/18/2018</h5>
				<p>
					Sometimes, you get data that you are skeptical of its validity. Like, if you were running an experiment and you found out that 30% of people who receive coke receive alcohol poisoning, while 100% of people who receive water receive alcohol poisoning.
					<br>
					There's actually a lot of statistical techniques to solve that problem! One of them is the binomial test.
					<br> <br>
					In any experiment, a hypothetical 'average' that the data would reflect on would usually exist. You expect A to be around 8%. You expect those who drink water to receive alcohol poisoning 2% of the time. Using the total sample and total population, you can calculate whether the results of the experiment are valid or not! <br> <br>
					A binomial test inputs the probability, sample size and sample's result to determine the probability of the result occurring. In the above example, say we fed 200 people coke, and 60 of them received alcohol poisoning. Also hypothetically assume that coke has a 1% chance of giving someone alcohol poisoning (psst it's actually 100%) <br>
					This means that <a href="https://mathcracker.com/mean-standard-deviation-binomial-distribution.php">the mean is 2 people and standard deviation is 1.4 people</a>. 60 people, from the experiment, means that the experiment's results is over 40 standard deviations from the mean! It's probability of occurring hence is infinitessimally small (less than 1 * 10^-10% actually). Subsequently, it is unreliable and thus the experiment's results can be thrown out the window. <br> <br>
					Normally if the result's probability of occurring is at least 5%, then it is significant enough for the experiment to be considered valid. But otherwise, like the example above, means that rethinking the experiment's procedure and removal of the poisoned bodies is necessary. <br> <br>

				<h2>Wave Function 2</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/14/2018</h5>
				<p>
					One wave strand should not cause an interference pattern! <br> <br>
					Unless... <br> <br>
					One wave strand acts like all wave strands! <br>
					For as long as a photon is not observed, the pattern emitted will be an interference one, due to the wave function. The wave function is a function that determines where a particle is located. So if a photon was for sure going to be at (0, 0), then it's wave function will equal 1 at (0,0) and 0 at everywhere else. <br>
					But if a photon can be at (0,0) with a 75% probability and (0,1) with a 25% probability, then its wave function will match accordingly. As a photon entering the interference board can be at any point, these probability strands are the ones that interfere and thus a interference pattern will occur, albeit hyper paradoxically. <br> <br>
					This requires zero observation, however, as once the photon is observed, the wave function collapses immediately and the photon receives a definite location (can be (0,0) or (0,1) with the given probabilities, but only present at 1 point than at both points). Thus, observing it will remove the interference pattern and you will get a single moving point.

				<h2>Random Mini Rants 1</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/8/2018</h5>
				<p>
					(Not an academic post, just random rants I wanted to go off for no reason at all) <br> <br>
					1. Grades <br>
					Honestly, I don't understand the massive stigma around getting good grades. I mean, yes, people should strive to achieve well in their classes at all levels. But sacrificing your sanity and sleep to boost grade by 1%? Crying so hard because of getting a 92 on a quiz? <br>
					Maybe people value that more than their personal lives, or maybe its because they intentionally pressure themselves into performing better. I'm not sure what the reason is, and there probably are outliers to this, but generally, I question the value of sacrificing your well being for an arbitrary point that may not make a difference, if any. <br> <br>
					2. Media <br>
					What happens when only one person dictates what you hear from the outside world? Not that that's a big deal or anything, but if a person says 'A' and that's all you hear, maybe you'll be inclined to believe only 'A' is correct and there are no other beliefs. Similarly, people who only hear 'B' are more likely to believe in only 'B'. I just think people should be willing to listen to all sides rather than shut off certain media just because they have a different opinion, because polarity results in distrust which results in exploitation which results in so many disastrous things, and I'd rather live than be forced to fight in another world war. <br> <br>
					3. Dihydrogen Monoxide <br>
					I'm not sure why we drink <a href="http://dhmo.org/facts.html">this</a>. I mean, according to what it says, we drink this so much and in reality it's so dangerous to us. Yay government led conspiracies. <br>
					(Please don't kill me this one is a joke) <br>

				<h2>Infrared</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/6/2018</h5>
				<p>
					All wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not part of the visible section are, frankly, not visible. Since they're not visible, how do we know they exist? <br>
					An experiment in trying to figure out the heat of different wavelengths did that. Before, all that was known was that white light would disperse into the different colors due to diffraction when given a narrow slit. An experimenter used a couple of thermometers to measure the temperatures at points struck by red light, yellow light, .etc. and had a few 'control' thermometers not being hit by the colors. <br> <br>
					What ended up happening instead was that the thermometer next to the red light thermometer read an abnormally higher temperature! <br> <br>
					This when experimented upon led to the discovery of infrared and ultraviolet waves, where 'infra' means below and 'ultra' means above, so infrared is below red in the EM spectrum and ultraviolet is above violet in the spectrum.

				<h2>Wave Function 1</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/4/2018</h5>
				<p>
					The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">Double-Slit Experiment</a> was an experiment used to measure the effect of diffraction on white light. Putting only two narrow openings from a light source to a surface, the experiment aimed to measure the effects of diffraction. After all, white light are made up of color waves like red waves (700 nm) to purple waves (400 nm), and according to how diffraction works, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Double_slit_interference.png">higher wavelengths (red) result in being further away than smaller wavelengths (purple)</a>. Or only one color of light is used to see how light from the source constructively and destructively interferes with each other. And the resulting image can be used to study how waves work. <br> <br>
					However, instead of using one source of light through a slit, say one photon is fired at a time through either slit. Normally this would mean zero light patterns as there cannot be any interference between photons. Despite this, an interference pattern occurs anyway. Why is this the case?
