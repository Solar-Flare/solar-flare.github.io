				<h2>Wave Function 1</h2>
				<h5>Date: 11/4/2018</h5>
				<p>
					The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">Double-Slit Experiment</a> was an experiment used to measure the effect of diffraction on white light. Putting only two narrow openings from a light source to a surface, the experiment aimed to measure the effects of diffraction. After all, white light are made up of color waves like red waves (700 nm) to purple waves (400 nm), and according to how diffraction works, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Double_slit_interference.png">higher wavelengths (red) result in being further away than smaller wavelengths (purple)</a>. Or only one color of light is used to see how light from the source constructively and destructively interferes with each other. And the resulting image can be used to study how waves work. <br> <br>
					However, instead of using one source of light through a slit, say one photon is fired at a time through either slit. Normally this would mean zero light patterns as there cannot be any interference between photons. Despite this, an interference pattern occurs anyway. Why is this the case?
