				<h2>Planck Length</h2>
				<h5>Date: 02/25/2019</h5>
				<p>
					There exists a minimum distance we can possible measure: The Planck Length. It is about 1.616 * 10^-35 meters in length. But why is it that we can't observe, say, 1.4 * 10^-35 meters? <br> <br>

					Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is an answer to this concept. It states that several properties of a particle has innate uncertainties tying them together. One such pair is location and momentum. The principle states that the uncertainty in location times the uncertainty in momentum is equal to or greater than the Planck Constant. <br> <br>

					Suppose you tried to measure a particle's location so accurately down to the planck length and beyond. This makes the uncertainty in location extremely small. Consequently, since the equation must hold, the uncertainty in momentum becomes so large. Since this means its velocity, and consequently its energy, also has a high uncertainty, this results in such a massive energy 'burst' that the particle that is trying to be observed at the planck length level to immediately collapse into a miniature black hole, unable to observe beyond this fundamental unit of length. <br> <br>

					In other words, if you want to ruin somebody's day, just observe their shirt down to the 1.616 * 10^-35 meter level.

				<h2>Dark Matter</h2>
				<h5>Date: 02/03/2019</h5>
				<p>
					Gravity pulls everything in the universe together. Like, you and the screen you are reading on is being pulled together at a negligible amount. Or the sun and Sirius A. <br>

					They also make things like galaxies work - a massive center (normally a large black hole) pulls everything in a sphere, spiral, or other shapes a galaxy exists in. Well, there was one problem. When people measured the amount of matter we can detect in a galaxy, they found out that the current amount of mass they saw in the galaxies do not impose enough gravitational attraction to keep them together. In other words, theoretically they should fly apart. <br> <br>

					So why are they not? <br>
					Some people theorize a 'dark matter' that is the most likely scenario that accounts for this low gravitational attraction. A normal galaxy's mass required for all of its parts to stay in the galactical shape is ten times the amount that we observe within a galaxy. This means there is an undetectable, large amount of this dark matter that allows this gravitational attraction to work. <br> <br>

					Some think this matter is something we've never seen before. Some think this is brown dwarfs - a very hard to detect small faint star that doesn't have the mass to chain-react nuclear fusion. It can also be comets, or rogue cold planets not attached to any star, or even a miscalculation of black hole's masses.
