				<h2>Dark Matter</h2>
				<h5>Date: 02/03/2019</h5>
				<p>
					Gravity pulls everything in the universe together. Like, you and the screen you are reading on is being pulled together at a negligible amount. Or the sun and Sirius A. <br>

					They also make things like galaxies work - a massive center (normally a large black hole) pulls everything in a sphere, spiral, or other shapes a galaxy exists in. Well, there was one problem. When people measured the amount of matter we can detect in a galaxy, they found out that the current amount of mass they saw in the galaxies do not impose enough gravitational attraction to keep them together. In other words, theoretically they should fly apart. <br> <br>

					So why are they not? <br>
					Some people theorize a 'dark matter' that is the most likely scenario that accounts for this low gravitational attraction. A normal galaxy's mass required for all of its parts to stay in the galactical shape is ten times the amount that we observe within a galaxy. This means there is an undetectable, large amount of this dark matter that allows this gravitational attraction to work. <br> <br>

					Some think this matter is something we've never seen before. Some think this is brown dwarfs - a very hard to detect small faint star that doesn't have the mass to chain-react nuclear fusion. It can also be comets, or rogue cold planets not attached to any star, or even a miscalculation of black hole's masses.
