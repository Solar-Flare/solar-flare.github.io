				<h1>Update! (Blog 1.1)</h1>
				<h5>Date: 06/09/2019</h5>
				<p>Yay life issues. <br>
				Anyways now that I'm done with a lot of my own problems I should be able to get back to working on this mini project of mine. For a while now I've worked on getting the code behind this to be a lot cleaner; while you won't see any major differences the code is now much, much shorter and the data files have been majorly reduced. <br>
				So yay! <br>
				I'm probably gonna return to writing random blog posts in a bit. <br>

				<h1>Hello World!</h1>
				<h5>Date: 8/20/2018 </h5>
				<p>This is just a really minor blog that I write as a means of reflecting on my projects, their progress, and also a way of testing my HTML/CSS skills~ </br>
				</br>
				Really amateurish stuff inbound.
