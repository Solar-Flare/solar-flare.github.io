        1
      </header>
      <p>1 is the first positive number!</p>
      <p>It's also neither prime nor composite.</p>
      <p>...Wait, are you sure this is a technical doc?</p>

        2
      </header>
      <p>2 is the first prime number!</p>
      <p>It's also the first even number, and the only even prime.</p>
      <p>It's also the amount of arms/legs we have (assuming you're human)</p>
      <code>double two = 2.0; //Doubles are like decimal numbers. Kinda like floats, but not really.</code> <br />
      <code>two += 0.0; // And you can add them to other decimals</code>

    <section class="main-section"id="3">
      <header>
        3
      </header>
      <p>3 is the second prime number!</p>
      <p>Also the first odd prime number. That's odd.</p>
      <p>It's also the number of sides on a triangle, the smallest sided polygon.</p>
      <p>We don't count circles as having 0 sides.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section"id="4">
      <header>
        4
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li>4 is the first composite number~!</li>
        <li>It's also the first square number (2*2 = 4)</li>
        <li>4 is also weirdly treated as unlucky by some people.</li>
        <li>Maybe it is unlucky, I have no idea.</li>
        <li>At this point, it should be obvious this has strayed from a technical doc.</li>
      </ul>
      <code>func getDouble(int n) {
        return n*n;
      }</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section"id="5">
      <header>
        5
      </header>
      <p>5 is the third prime number~!</p>
      <p>It's also one of the few numbers with a very obvious divisibility rule; just see the last digit.</p>
      <p>The only other number with this property is 2 and 10.</p>
      <p>This has something to do with integers modulo 10, but that's too technical for now.</p>

      You're actually bamboozled. This is not a techincal doc, but a brief desc of the first 5 positive numbers.
