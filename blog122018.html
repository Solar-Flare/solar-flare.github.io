					Yay, universities. <br>
					The Asian Parents' sole goal of life, and the one thing that high schools enslave themselves over. <br>
					In some ways, this toxic thought process grew over the fact that people have figured out what colleges want, and this push for getting into good colleges grew and grew until stats now are so atomically high that you wonder if some kids should even be going into colleges. <br>
					In a way, this is perpetuated by the fact that people want to get in, and demand rises, which means low supply and high costs -> economics! <br> <br>

					On the subject of dimensions <br>

					A dimension is really just a way of expressing vectors. Like, a 1 dimension expresses vectors in 1 direction. <br>
					(5) describes a vector going 5 in the positive axis, while (-2) describes a vector going 2 in the negative axis, for instance. <br> 
					You can add more dimensions! Our current world is comprehended in 3 geometric dimensions (and time but we're just gonna ignore that), and a point in this world can be expressed as a vector from the origin to the point! <br>
					If you had a point at (2,3,8), then the vector (2,3,8) for instance would map this point out using the 3 dimensions given. <br>
					In other words, a means of defining 4, 5, 6... dimensions is found as a result; we just don't comprehend it yet. Or maybe we do. Some theoreticals have been done but so far we have yet to see a real 4D world (not including time) in action.

				<h2>Dimensions, Part 2, Part 1</h2>

					The Big Bang was undoubtedly one of the craziest events that allowed our universe to be where it is currently: A c o n s t a n t l y e x p a n d i n g sphere of happiness. <br>
					Or solemness. Whatever floats your boat. <br> <br>

					Within the singularity contained the four fundamental forces fused into a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">grand unified force</a> that split into the four forces we know today (theoretically could be five with electricity and magnetism splitting off). <br> <br>

					A main theory that pervades physics today, however, suggests that forces weren't the only thing that broke off with the advent of the Big Bang. The superstring theory, that every particle is merely a vibration of a string that subsides at the entire universe, requires 10 possible dimensions. <br> <br>
					Why does our universe only have 4 dimensions, then? (3 for geometric and time being the 4th dimension) Because the big bang forced a split of the dimensions into the 4 dimensions that make up the universe, and 6 dimensions, that might be anything. Some theories suggest it's infinitessimally small that make up particles, and other theories suggest we're living in a universe that is in itself a part of some other large puzzle. <br>
					Either way, the developments in these fields are certainly interesting.
