				<h2>Dimensions, Part 2, Part 1</h2>
				<h5>Date: 12/09/2018</h5>
				<p>
					The Big Bang was undoubtedly one of the craziest events that allowed our universe to be where it is currently: A c o n s t a n t l y e x p a n d i n g sphere of happiness. <br>
					Or solemness. Whatever floats your boat. <br> <br>

					Within the singularity contained the four fundamental forces fused into a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">grand unified force</a> that split into the four forces we know today (theoretically could be five with electricity and magnetism splitting off). <br> <br>

					A main theory that pervades physics today, however, suggests that forces weren't the only thing that broke off with the advent of the Big Bang. The superstring theory, that every particle is merely a vibration of a string that subsides at the entire universe, requires 10 possible dimensions. <br> <br>
					Why does our universe only have 4 dimensions, then? (3 for geometric and time being the 4th dimension) Because the big bang forced a split of the dimensions into the 4 dimensions that make up the universe, and 6 dimensions, that might be anything. Some theories suggest it's infinitessimally small that make up particles, and other theories suggest we're living in a universe that is in itself a part of some other large puzzle. <br>
					Either way, the developments in these fields are certainly interesting.
